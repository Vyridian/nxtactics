				* Microgravity - 0G to .2G - Microgravity only exists in space and on moons. Low gravity favors the development of tall, slight frames who will have much difficulty in 1G environments. Worlds with such low gravities do not maintain an atmosphere.
				* Very Low Gravity - .2G to .5G - Very Low gravity exists on small planets and
				large moons. Low gravity favors the development of tall, slight frames who will
				have difficulty in 1G environments. Worlds with such low gravities do not maintain
				an atmosphere.
				* Low Gravity - .5G to .8G - Low exists on smaller planets. Low gravity favors
				the development of tall frames. Worlds with low gravities will have thin
				atmospheres and consequently be exposed to higher levels of radiation.
				* Terran Gravity - .8G to 1.2G
				* High Gravity - 1.2G to 1.5G - High gravity exists on larger planets. High gravity
				favors short, heavy frames.
				* Very High Gravity - 1.5G to 2.5G - Very high gravity exists on larger planets.
				Very high gravity favors short, heavy frames.
				* Intense Gravity - 1.8G to 2.5G - Intense gravity exists on gas giant planets
				like Jupiter. Few creatures can survive such extreme gravity where the atmosphere
				is extremely dense.
				* Extreme Gravity - 2.5G+ - Extreme gravity exists on stars like the Sun (28G) with
				the extreme end being a Neutron star (300,000,000,000G) or a black hole.

				* Micropressure - 0 to .5 atmospheres - Micropressure only exists in space and even on
				Terran-sized planets (such as Mars). Most creatures cannot survive such low
				pressure.
				* Low Pressure - .5 to .8 atmospheres - Low pressure can exist on Terran-sized
				planets and very large moons. Low pressure favors the development of expanded lung
				capacity and relative resistance to hypoxia. Conversely such creatures struggle
				when breathing the 'soup' of higher pressure environments and may require
				breathing aids.
				* Terran Gravity - .8 to 1.5 atmospheres - Terran normal
				* High Presssure - 1.5 to 4 atmospheres - High pressure exists on larger planets
				and underwater on any planet.
				* Very High Pressure - 4 to 100 atmospheres -
				* Intense Pressure - 100 to 1000 atmospheres - Equal to the bottom of the terran
				ocean.

		<rule name="Space Heat Disspation">
			<summary>
				* There are three modes of heat transfer: conduction, convection, and radiation.
				The first two require a medium that space does not provide, so most heat is
				dissipated via radiation, but when necessary, heat can also be dissipated by
				vaporizing a small amount of reaction mass.

		<rule name="Space Movement">
			<summary>
				* Use [Vector Movement] rules with the following modifications.
				* All objects are always moving.  Only the relative difference in speed is important, not the speed itself.
				* In space, [Speed] represents acceleration/deceleration and is measured in g's (1g=10m/s/s).
				* Given sufficient fuel, there is no practical maximum to the speed attainable.  It would take 3.5 days at 1g to reach
				1% of the speed of light.

				* Space Travel is a two-piece problem; accelerate for half time (and half distance), then decelerate the other half time (and distance).
				* Travel Time: If you know the desired acceleration of your spacecraft (generally one g or 9.81 m/s2) and wish to calculate the transit time, the Brachistochrone equation is:
				** T = 2 * sqrt[ D/A ]
				** where T = transit time (seconds), D = distance (meters), A = acceleration (m/s2)

				* Travel Time with Coasting: Spacecraft that cannot accelerate the entire distance must coast during the middle of the trip and use the following calculation:
				** T = ((D - (A * t^2)) / (A * t)) + (2*t)
				** where T = transit time (seconds), D = distance (meters), A = acceleration (m/s2), t = duration of acceleration
				phase (seconds), just the acceleration phase only, NOT the acceleration+deceleration phase.
				* Note that the coast duration time is of course = T - (2*t)
				* Acceleration: If you know the desired transit time and wish to calculate the required acceleration, the equation
				is: A = (4 * D) / T2

				* The monthly cycle of the moon, in contrast to the annual cycle of the sun's path, has been implicitly linked to
				women's menstrual cycles by many cultures, although rarely explicitly stated.  Many of the most well-known
				mythologies feature female lunar deities.
			</reference>
			<summary>
				* The moon rotates on its axis in about 27 days. Daytime on one side of the
				moon lasts about 13 and a half days, followed by 13 and a half nights of
				darkness. When sunlight hits the moon's surface, the temperature can reach
				253 degrees F (123 C). The dark side can have temperatures dipping to minus
				243 F (minus 153 C).
				* New Moon - A person born under the new moon will have an underlying sense of youthful enthusiasm and optimism.
				They will probably prefer to take the initiative, especially in romance, and will be ready to look for new
				interests in life, new people and new ideas.  The person will see how things can be improved and can spur others
				to action, before leaving them to finish the project.  They need to guard against selfishness and taking others
				by surprise with over quick and hasty reactions.
				* Waxing Moon - A person born under a waxing moon will be ambitious and sociable.  The person will be locked into
				their goals and have a strong need to create something which will be remembered by others.  They will have a
				charismatic personality that draws others to them, but may instinctively use others for their own ends, rather
				than help them.  They prefer a career where they are out in front and have attention and status.  The person will
				be slow to anger, but formidable when aroused, and hates to be hurried or presented with a fait accompli.
				However, they won't mind doing this to others if it tips the odds in their favor.
				* Full Moon - A person born under a full moon will be sensitive to the needs of others and expects others to be
				sensitive to their own needs.  There is an underlying sense of watchfulness.  The person will need friendships,
				colleagues and relationships, and will relate well to others.  They will either be drawn to highly successful
				people and help them achieve their goals, or else achieve success themselves with the help of others.  There is a
				tension and nervousness at play which can lead to a short attention span and a constant search for new people and
				experiences, and sex will play some kind of transformative role in their life.
				* Waning Moon - A person born under a waning moon will finish the projects that others start, and reorganize and sort out the problems left by others. They will often have clairvoyant insight and follow hunches rather than be logical. The person can be too sensitive and become upset by the demands of others, and can also be too inclined to sit back and let things happen.

		* Philosophy - Though we are now able to travel through time, there remains much speculation
		over how time travel actually works. The general concensus is that the term 'Time Stream' may
		be an accurate description. Time acts like a river of water, and we are travelers on that
		river. But our boats are unpowered, so we drift with the current until we hit the shore. Now,
		with the power of the Time Rotor, we may move against the current of time to any time or
		place we choose.

		* The Vortex - The Vortex is a temporal zero-point where time does not exist. The Vortex appears
		as a tunnel headed away from the viewer regardless of which direction the viewer looks. Entering
		the Vortex is feels like dying (and probably is a death). Exiting the Vortex is like being born
		(or reborn).
		* Beings and objects may travel through the the [Vortex] emerging at another point in Time. Every
		point in time is equi-distant from the [Vortex].

				Time Travellers
				* Emphemeral - Those who have never traveled in time are called Ephemerals. All the events of
				their lives may be altered repeatedly by one or more time travelers, and they will not sense
				anything is amiss or remember anything about the previous time stream.
				* Temporal - Once a being travels through time, it is permanently separated from the normal
				time stream and is called a Temporal. The events of a Temporal's life may also be changed by
				other time travelers, but a Temporal will remember some or all of the previous time stream.

				* A Temporal has one limitation that Emphemerals do not: the moment of death of a Temporal
				cannot be undone. Since only living beings may travel through time, when a Temporal dies, he
				or she can no longer move forward in time. Even if time is rewritten to prevent the
				Temporal's death, the time traveler will still die at the exact age of his original death
				regardless of the circumstances. The cause of death may vary, but death will always occur at
				the exact age that the original death happened.

		<rule name="Law of Preservation">
			<summary>
				* Jumping through time necessarily causes a number of paradoxes, but Time seems to have a
				self-healing mechanism that limits the scope of changes to the Timeline, provided the changes
				are small enough. One of these effects is when a person makes a time jump, that jump cannot
				cause a series of events that ultimately prevents itself. For example: say a person jumped
				back in time because of a temporal disturbance. He then prevented the disturbance from ever
				happening. Logically, this is a paradox. If the disturbance never happened, then he would
				never go back to prevent the disturbance, so the disturbance would happen, so he would go
				back to prevent the disturbance, etc. Instead the last jump that prevents the disturbance
				occurs, the disturbance never occurs, and all memory of what happened during the paradox is
				lost. This time period has become complex but is stable. Of course, a further time jump
				might erase the actions of the previous jump, since the last jump will always stand despite
				any paradoxes created.

		<rule name="Loop Trap Paradox">
			<summary>
				* Whenever two versions of same person exist at the same point in time, a Loop Trap Paradox is created. The future version of the person immediately vanishes and the past version of the person performs the same actions that the future version did eventually returning to the same moment where both versions exist at the same time and the cycle continues eternally. The person is doomed to repeat the same actions over and over again unless another time traveler intervenes.

		<rule name="Matter Suppression">
			<summary>
				* Matter cannot normally travel through time, but time technology allows certain narrow
				exceptions. Living matter can travel freely through time, seemingly based only on the will to
				live. Non-living matter, however, decomposes rapidly when moved through time. Non-living
				objects that travel backwards in time decompose faster the farther back in time they travel.
				Non-living objects that travel forward in time beyond their original time period decompose
				immediately. For this reason, no one has been able to travel to a future beyond their time
				machines 'present' because their time machines vanish stranding them in the Vortex.
			</summary>
		</rule>
		<rule name="Messages in Time">
			<summary>
				* With the benefit of hindsight, there are many times when it would be convenient to send a
				message to a past version of yourself to change a course of action. Of course, this would be
				a paradox: if you don't take the same action in the past, you would never send the message to
				change the action. If you did attempt to leave a message to a past self, the rule of Matter
				Suppression would cause the message to disappear to prevent the paradox. However, by placing
				a message in the Time Rotor, the message can resist Matter Suppression for up to 1 day. If
				the message is successfully delivered, the future self will typically vanish immediately
				since that future will have been erased in favor of a new future created by the message.
				* Self Preventing Mission - Using a Message in Time, it is possible to prevent every reason
				why the initial Time Travel was made. In this case, the mission never occurs, though memories
				of the trip may remain.

				changes will, however, create a Temporal Distortion Wave. This wave in time will slowly
				flow around the changed events, making minor alterations in names and events as it goes.
				Eventually, the wave subsides when history goes back on course with only minor changes to the
				history books. For Example: killing Hitler as a baby will have little effect on history,
				because the time stream will find someone else to fill his role, and the history books will
				just have different names.
				* Severity - A Distortion Wave is rated based on the number of years it will travel before
				the time stream returns to its normal course. History during this period is altered, but time
				futureward of the wave is relatively normal.
				* Detection - A person that experiences a wave washing through his/her time stream will
				experience radical changes to events. Of course, only time travelers will notice these
				changes as unusual. Those that can analyze the time stream can see the wave traveling through
				time. If a person is futureward of the wave, he/she will not detect any changes until the
				wave approaches.
				* Stopping the Wave - A Wave can still be stopped by jumping forward in time past the wave
				and choosing major events that took place in the normal time stream and forcing them to
				happen again despite the changes the oncoming Wave would create. This action will act as a
				dam, preventing the Wave from doing further damage to the future. The time stream is now
				safe, but the work is not complete because a Standing Wave has been created.
				* Standing Wave- A Distortion Wave that has been stopped futureward will be reflected back
				to the past changing history back again until it reaches its origin and reflected futureward
				again repeatining the process, changing time back and forth infinitely in what is called a
				Standing Wave. A Standing Wave remains very dangerous and can only be ended by preventing the
				original source of the wave which will return the time stream to normal.

				* When a Temporal has his time stream rewritten by another Time Traveler, it is possible
				to retain dream-like memories of the time line that no longer exists.

				* Traveling to Ones Own Future - Time machines cannot travel farther forward in time beyond
				their 'present'. Any attempt to do so results in the immediate disintegration of the time
				machine and passengers are stranded in the Vortex.
				* Futureward Time Hops - The simplest way of performing multiple time hops is to travel back
				to a time period and then make a number of futureward hops from there. In this way one can
				see the development of a subject over time such as the construction of a building. It also
				allow one to view the consequences of any changes made to history.
				* Futureward Time Hops Complications - Making forward hops essentially avoids paradoxes, but
				other problems can occur. People may recognize you which can be a problem if your appearance
				hasn't changed. They may ask questions about the intervening time and why they never kept in
				touch. If you keep arriving in the same spot at different times, you may set yourself up for
				an ambush. Be cautious and change your physical destination as well as your temporal on each
				jump.

			<summary>
				* Traveling to Ones Own Past - Any attempt to enter a time period where you have already been creates a [Loop Trap Paradox]. Your future version immediately vanishes and the past version infinitely repeats the steps leading to the Loop Trap.
				* Pastward Time Hops - Multiple jumps back in time are often desirable because as one learns more about the current situation it is usually easier to go further back in time to alter the situation before it has fully developed. When done perfectly, the original problem can be prevented entirely.
				* Pastward Time Hops Complications - Altering the past is the way to create paradoxes. Multiple pastward hops increases the risk with each hop. As you progressively change the past, you may also cause changes to your own past. You can find yourself appearing in a time period with no memory of why.
