cavalry combined with light infantry allowed great tactical speed and versatility on the battlefield.

Historically, Germanic tribes did not frequently use cavalry, however, some tribes were known for their
cavalry and many peoples praised the good quality of Germanic cavalry.  Though their horses were not
exceptional, Germanic horsemen could still maneuver very well and operated as a unit, rather than as an

       "Examples of Play
Romans vs. Greeks
Combat Example:

	Opponent must be unaware
Effects:
	+4 Attack
	Opponent can only defend

Use when:
	Longer Reach
	In Melee Combat
	Not in Close Combat
Effects:
	First Strike
	+2 Attack
	+4 Damage Vs Charge
	Opponent cannot move into Close Combat if you hit.

Charge:
Effect:
Use when:
	Not in Melee Combat
Effect:
	Full Move Attack
	+2 Damage
	Moves into Close Combat

Guard:
Effect:
	+2 Defense
	All hits taken are shield hits

Example:
Human attacks the Orc in the open.
The Orc has longer reach an chooses Hold Off.
The Human is wary of the spear and plays Guard and Close Combat.

Round 1:
Orc roll: 12 + 9 Spear + 2 Hold Off = 23
Human roll: 9 + 8 Sword + 2 Guard - 1 Encumberance = 18

Orc scores a hit for 5 + 3 Spear = 8 Damage

Guard makes the damage a shield hit.
Determine hit location.
8 (Piercing) - 3 (Shield) - 3 (Armor) = 2 (Piercing) Wound.

Body reduces by 2 to 10 not enough to change bonus.

The successful Hold Off means the Human's Close Combat Movement fails."))))
