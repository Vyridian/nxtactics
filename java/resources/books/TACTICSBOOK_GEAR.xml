			<summary>
				* Purpose - The valknut pendant is a magical symbol for warrior types. The Valknut pendant is used by those who swear allegiance to Odin in both life and death and want to fight alongside the gods during Ragnarok. When a valknut is found, Odin is also near. This is true for engravings of the valknut as well as for those who decide to wear Odin’s symbol.
				* Description - Valknut literally translates into 'the knot of the fallen warriors.' This symbol is also strongly connected to the deceased as is apparent in its linguistic meaning. The symbol itself represents the 9 worlds of existence. It is created through the fierce binding of three triangles. The Valknut also has the power over both life and death, as it weaves both into a knot.

			<reference>
				* Silver is a brilliant white metal with a luster that can take a high degree of polish.
				* It is very ductile and malleable (slightly harder than gold).
				* It has the highest electrical conductivity of all metals, even higher than copper
				* Among metals, pure silver has the highest thermal conductivity (only the non-metal
				diamond's is higher), whitest color, and the highest optical reflectivity.
				* Jewellery and silverware are traditionally made from Sterling silver (Standard silver) an
				alloy of 92.5 % silver with 7.5% copper.  Sterling silver is harder than pure silver,
				and has a lower melting point.
				* It has certain antimicrobial activity.  Dilute solutions of silver nitrate can be used
				as disinfectants.  Silver-ions and silver compounds show a toxic effect on some
				bacteria, viruses, algae and fungi.  Its germicidal effects make silver utensils valued,
				and increase its value as jewelry.  The exact process of silver's germicidal effect is
				still not well understood.
				* The name of the United Kingdom monetary unit 'pound' originally had the value of one
				troy pound of sterling silver.
				* The words for 'silver' and 'money' are the same in at least 14 languages.
				* Hippocrates, the father of modern medicine, wrote that silver had beneficial healing
				and anti-disease properties, and the Phoenicians used to store water, wine, and vinegar
				in silver bottles to prevent spoiling.  In the early 1900s people would put silver
				dollars in milk bottles to prolong the milk's freshness.
				* Silver was believed to be a repellent against vampires; also, mirrors were originally
				polished silver, and as such, vampires allegedly cannot be seen in them because they
				have no soul) and it was also believed that a werewolf, in his bestial form, could only
				be killed by a weapon or bullet made of silver.  This has given rise to the term 'silver
				bullet', which is used to describe things that very effectively deal with one specific
				problem.

			<summary>
				* Astronomical computer for solving problems relating to time and the position of the Sun and stars in the sky.
				To use an astrolabe, you adjust the moveable components to a specific date and time.  Once set, the entire sky,
				both visible and invisible, is represented on the face of the instrument.  This allows a great many astronomical
				problems to be solved in a very visual way.
				* Typical uses of the astrolabe include finding the time during the day or night, finding the time of a celestial
				event such as sunrise or sunset and as a handy reference of celestial positions.
