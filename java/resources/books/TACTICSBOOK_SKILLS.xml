				* What you call tao. It's a power everyone possesses innately, but mastering it allows one to achieve superhuman abilities... But you must be careful how you use it. Tao is life itself. Use too much, and you'll exhaust more than just your stamina... In the worst case, overuse likely leads to death. - Shion-dono , Hell's Paradise

					* Bounty Hunting represents experience in stalking and capturing a target in an urban setting. This is traditionally done for money and can be quite profitable.
					* Bounties are placed on people for whom the law lacks the resources or inclination to pursue.
					* Bounties are placed by insurance companies, bail bondsmen, armies, the F.B.I., and individuals.
					* The reward can be paid for information, the capture of the target in a reasonably uninjured state, or even dead or alive.
					* The reward obviously needs to be commensurate with the difficulty or no one will take it. Capturing is harder than killing, so captures gain a bonus.

Raiding tombs is a fairly lawless and perilous activity to start with, and such high value items tend to attract disreputable characters of all kinds. As a result, treasure hunters often end their careers in unfortunate accidents.

				* The Jink and Barrel Roll maneuvers simply make it harder for the plane to be hit.
				* The Half Loop, Wingover, and Falling Leaf are all attempts to loose an enemy that's tailing you.
				* The Loop, Immelman, and Retournment are all attempts to both loose a tail, abd to end up tailing that foe
				yourself.
				* When a 'dogged' plane attempts a maneuver to escape his tail the pilot needs to succeed in the maneuver.  If he
				fails his roll, then he's still being tailed, if he succeeds, then the tailing pilot gets to attempt the same
				maneuver (as a 'free' action at full dice pool) - if the 'tail' matches or exceeds the successes rolled by the
				target plane's pilot, then the tail is maintained for another turn.
				* When a dogged plane attempts a 'reversal' maneuver the effects are the same, except that if the tailing plane
				scores less successes than the target plane, the roles are reversed.

					Small dinghies frequently capsize in the normal course of use and are occasionally deliberately capsized as it can be the fastest means of draining water from the boat.

					In a storm, even large vessels may be rolled by being hit broadside by a large wave. This is normally catastrophic for larger ships.

					* Differential Calculus - The definition, properties, and applications of the derivative of a function. The process of finding the derivative is called differentiation.
					* Integral Calculus - The definitions, properties, and applications of two related concepts, the indefinite integral and the definite integral. The process of finding the value of an integral is called integration.
					* Calculus is used in every branch of the physical sciences, actuarial science, computer science, statistics, engineering, economics, business, medicine, demography, and in other fields wherever a problem can be mathematically modeled and an optimal solution is desired.
					* Physics makes particular use of calculus; all concepts in classical mechanics are interrelated through calculus. The mass of an object of known density, the moment of inertia of objects, as well as the total energy of an object within a conservative field can be found by the use of calculus.
					* Electricity and Magnetism - Calculus can be used to find the total flux of electromagnetic fields. A more historical example of the use of calculus in physics is Newton's second law of motion, it expressly uses the term 'rate of change' which refers to the derivative.
					* Medicine - Calculus can be used to find the optimal branching angle of a blood vessel so as to maximize flow.
					* Economics - Calculus allows for the determination of maximal profit by providing a way to easily calculate both marginal cost and marginal revenue.
