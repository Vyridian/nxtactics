			* Fully-Automatic Weapons - These weapons fire continuously as long as the
			trigger is held down, or until they run out of ammunition, or until the
			barrel warps from the heat.
			* Burst Weapons - This is usually a setting on Fully-Automatic Weapons
			that fires a number of shots, roughly 3, each time the trigger is pulled.
			This is a compromise between Fully and Semi-Automatic Modes.
			* Semi-Automatic weapons - These weapons are generally capable of fully
			automatic fire, but are limited to fire a single shot each time the trigger
			is pulled. As such, they are limited to the shooter's ability to pull the
			trigger, generally once every second.

	<section name="Aiming and Range">
		<summary>
			* It takes 3 seconds to aim a weapon at a target.
			* Range - Each 50m range takes an additional 1 second to aim. Pistols incur -1 Attack per 50m. Rifles incur -1 Attack per 100m.
			* Aiming with a Scope - Using a scope triples the aim time and the effective range.

			* Damage
			* Armor (mm)
			* Energy (J)
			* Explosive Force (psi)
			* Mass (kg)

			The following table is an attempt to unify Damage, Armor, Energy, Explosive Force, Strength, and Mass together. This is done with the following premises:
			1) Where possible use factual comparisons between Weapons and Armor that defeated those weapons.
			2) Once damage and armor are mapped, the energy created from each firearm can be derived by muzzle velocity and weapon calibre.
			3) Energy in Joules (J) is easily converted into explosive force measured in PSI
			4) Energy may also easily be converted into a strength rating by determining how much mass that energy would lift over a person's head (3m) in 1 second.
			5) Finally the mass rating from strength can be used as a general chart for mass (and by correlation Body).

			The formula is Energy = Mass (kg) * ((3m ^ 2) / 1s * 10m / 1s / 1s.
			Simplified the formula is Energy = Mass (kg) * 100.

			* The resistance to penetration of armor is related to the thickness of the steel - 2mm armor required about 3 times as much energy to defeat as 1mm armor.
			* By its apex, hardened steel plate was almost impregnable on the battlefield. Knights were instead increasingly felled by polearms such as the halberd and blunt weapons such as maces or war hammers that could send concussive force through the plate armor resulting in injuries such as broken bones, organ hemorrhage and/or head trauma. Another tactic was to attempt to strike through the gaps between the armor pieces, using daggers, spears and spear points to attack the man-at-arms' eyes or joints.
			* Weight - A full suit of medieval plate is thought to have weighed little more than 60 lb (27 kg) on average, considerably lighter than the equipment often carried by the elite of today's armies. If during the 14-15th centuries armour seldom weighed more than 15kgs, than by the late 16th century it weighed 25kg. The increasing weight and thickness of late 16th century armor therefore gave substantial resistance.
			* Proof - In the early years of pistol and arquebuses, firearms were relatively low in velocity. The full suits of armour, or breast plates actually stopped bullets fired from a modest distance. The front breast plates were, in fact, commonly shot as a test. The impact point would often be encircled with engraving to point it out. This was called the 'proof'. Rather than making plate armour obsolete, the use of firearms stimulated the development of plate armour into its later stages.
			* At the end of the 1800's silk body armor was worn by those who could afford it. The assassination of Arch-Duke Ferdinand that precipitated WWI was wearing silk body armor but was shot in the neck over the armor. A similar vest worn by Alfonso XIII of Spain saved his life in 1901.
			* Criminal gangs in late 1920's to early 1930's began wearing thick cotton and cloth suits that could absorb .22, .25, .32 Long, .32, .380 ACP, and .45 ACP rounds. To overcome this, law enforcement began using .357 Magnum rounds.
			* Club, Axe or Greek sword : 1kg ; used single handed ; 65 joules(48 ft lbs)
			* Club, Axe or Greek sword : 2kg ; used two-handed ; 130 joules(96 foot lbs)
			* Javelin :0.8 kg ; thrown, with run-up; 198 joules(146 ft lbs)
			* Javelin :0.8 kg ; thrown, one pace only; 111 joules(83 ft lbs)
			* Javelin :0.8 kg ; thrown standing; 60 joules(49 ft lbs)
			* Javelin :0.8 kg ; thrown, one pace with loop ; 160 joules(118 ft lbs)
			* Light spear or small sword/dagger :0.8 kg ; close combat ; 30 joules(24 ft lbs)
			* Sarissa :8(?)kg ; two-hand thrust,pace fwd ; 160 joules(118 ft lbs)
			* Spear-butt : various ; thrust down, coup-de-grace; 50 joules (40 ft lbs)
			* Energies of the order of 30-60 joules (24-49 ft lbs) could be given generally to typical Greek Hand weapons, and armour would need to resist this type of thrust, as well as slashing blows up to 60 joules(49 ft lbs)
			* Sling bullet :24g swung one handed ; 30-36 joules(22-27 ft lbs)
			* Light bow 20J at 50m, 15J at 100m, 9J at 200m (sufficient to penetrate flesh)
			* Heavy bow 30J at 50 metres, 26J at 100 metres, 20J at 200 metres
			* Ballistic Armor Level I protects against .22 cal Long Rifle and .38
			* Ballistic Armor Level IIA protects against 9mm Low Velocity and .40 cal
			* Ballistic Armor Level II protects against 9mm and .357 Magnum
			* Ballistic Armor Level IIIA protects against High Velocity 9mm and .44 Magnum
			* Ballistic Armor Level III protects against 7.62 Rifle
			* Ballistic Armor Level IV protects against .30 cal Armor Piercing Rifle
			* All heavy armor penetration values are in mm of steel or equivalent at 30 degrees.
			* The 5.56 AP round penetrates 12mm at 100m.
			* The 7.92 MG round penetrates 13mm at 100m.
			* The 7.62 AP round penetrates 15mm at 300m.
			* .50 cal penetrates 20mm Armor
			* 20mm penetrates 30mm Armor.  It took an average of twenty 20mm hits to shoot down a WWII bomber.
			* 30mm A-10 penetrates 69mm at 500m and 38mm at 1000m.  A 30mm Autocannon could bring down a WWII bomber in 1-3 hits.
			* 40mm Bofors penetrates: 0 yards-2.7in (68mm), 2,000 yards-1.2in (30mm), 4,000 yards-0.60in, 6000 yards-0.45in.
			* 50mm PaK 38 was one of the few early guns capable of effectively penetrating the 45 mm armor of the formidable T-34
			* The PaK 40 penetrates 100mm Armor and was effective against almost every Allied tank until the end of the war.
			* The Panther's 75 mm KwK 42 L/70 penetrates 120mm at 1000m
			* Very few Allied or Soviet weapons could penetrate the Panther's front armor.
			* Pershing's 90mm penetrates 110mm at 1000m
			* The Tiger's 8.8 cm KwK 36 L/56 penetrates 135mm at 1000m.
			* Whereas Panthers were the more serious threat to Allied tanks, Tigers had a bigger psychological effect on  opposing crews, causing a 'Tiger phobia'. Allied tankers would sometimes evade rather than confront a Tiger, even a tank that only looked like one, such as the Panzer IV with turret skirts applied. In the Normandy campaign, it could take four to five Shermans to knock out a single Tiger tank by maneuvering to its weaker flank or rear armor; the Soviet T-34s fared similarly against the German tanks, as had the German PzIII earlier against the Soviet heavy tanks. An accepted Allied tactic was to engage the Tiger as a group, one attracting the attention of the Tiger crew while the others attacked the sides or rear of the vehicle. Since the ammunition and fuel were stored in the sides, a side penetration often resulted in a kill. This was, however, a risky tactic, and often resulted in the loss of several Allied vehicles. It took a great deal of tactical skill to eliminate a Tiger.
			* IS-2's A-19 122mm penetrates 150mm at 1000m and can go through the front and rear armor and the engine block of the German Panther tank.
			* The 17 pounder mounted on the Sherman Firefly was able to penetrate 131mm at 1000 meters, more than sufficient to defeat the German Tiger I and Panther tank at standard combat ranges.
			* Pershing 90mm APCR penetrates 192mm at 1000m
			* The Tiger II/Elefant/PaK43's 8.8 cm KwK 43 penetrates 165mm at 1000m
			* The M4 Sherman was unable to penetrate the front of a Tiger II even at point blank and the M26 Pershing and IS-2 had to come within 1300 m and 200 m respectively.
			* The Tiger II's 88 mm armament could penetrate 165mm at 1000m and destroy all Allied armor at a range far outside the effective range of the enemy's armament. Also, notwithstanding its reliability problems, the Tiger II was remarkably agile for such a heavy vehicle. Contemporary German records indicate that it had a lower ground pressure and was as maneuverable as the much lighter Panzer IV.
			* A typical modern lined shaped charge can penetrate armor steel to a depth of 7 or more times the diameter of the charge's cone (cone diameters, CD), though greater depths of 10 CD and above are now feasible.
			* The shaped charge of the PanzerFaust could penetrate up to 200 mm of steel, enough to defeat any armoured fighting vehicle of the period including T-34's and IS-2.
			* RPG-16 and M72 LAW can penetrate 300mm
			* RPG-22 can penetrate 400mm
			* RPG-7 can penetrate 500mm
			* M1 Abrams cannot penetrate its own 610mm Sloped Armor
			* RPG-29 can penetrate 750mm and has penetrated the front armor of a Challenger 2.
			* BLU-109 Penetrator - Penetration of reinforced concrete: 1.8 m (6 ft)
			* BLU-116 Advanced Unitary Penetrator (AUP), BLU-118/B Thermobaric Warhead - Penetration of reinforced concrete: 3.4m
			(11 ft)
			* BLU-113 Super Penetrator - Penetration of reinforced concrete: more than 6m (20 ft)
			* The crippled Bismark endured 5 torpedoes and a relentless attack by the 14 inch guns of 2 Battleships and the 8 inch guns of 2 Heavy Cruisers even at point blank range for over half an hour. The upper decks were destroyed, but the ship was still under power and the hull was relatively sound. It was finally scuttled by the crew.

			* Penetration of materials vs 5.56mm: http://www.inetres.com/gp/military/infantry/rifle/556mm_ammo.html
			** The following stop a 5.56mm round fired at less than 50 meters:
			*** One thickness of well-packed sandbags.
			*** A 2 inch (51 mm) non-reinforced concrete wall.
			*** A 55 gallon drum filled with water or sand.
			*** A small ammunition can filled with sand.
			*** A cinder block filled with sand (block will probably shatter).
			*** A plate glass windowpane at a 45 degree angle (glass fragments may be thrown behind the glass).
			*** A brick veneer.
			*** A layer of books 18 to 24 inches (457 to 610 mm) thick.
			** The following do not stop a 5.56mm round fired at less than 50 meters:
			*** Interior walls made of thin wood paneling, sheetrock, or plaster
			*** Common office furniture, such as desks and chairs
			*** Wooden frame buildings and single cinder block walls offer little protection from 5.56mm rounds.
			*** A car body (round will penetrate but normally not exit).

			* 40mm High Explosive dual purpse round
			** Penetrate 2 inches (50 mm) of armorplate, 12 inches (300 mm) of pine logs, 16 inches (400 mm) of concrete blocks,
			or 20 inches (500 mm) of sandbags at ranges up to 1,312 feet (400 m).

			* Sandbags = 1/10th Steel
			* Concrete = 1/8th Steel
			* Pine Logs = 1/6th Steel

				* Flechettes are fin stabilized steel projectiles similar in appearance to arrows. During the Korean War the Chinese army tactic of human wave attacks against US lines of defence prompted interest in flechette projectiles in single and multiple projectile systems for small arms and antipersonnel (APERS) use. Flechettes have a performance criteria very different from the conventional rifle bullet. Typical modern flechettes are small light weight steel projectiles, and the velocity lost to air resistance is generally 375 fps. per 100 Meters of flight. Unlike rifle bullets, flechettes are not spin stabilized, but use fins to achieve level flight. The flechette's long body looses rigidity on target impact and bends into a hook, often breaking off the fin portion creating an additional wound. Flechette munitions include projectiles for use in the M16 rifle, CAWS (close assault weapons system), and 12 gage shotgun, as well as the 105mm M101A1/M102 howitzer, 2.75 in.

			<summary>
				* Approximately 30% of the energy released by the explosive detonation is used to fragment the case and impart kinetic energy to the fragments. The balance of available energy is used to create a shock front and blast effects. The fragments are propelled at high velocity, and after a short distance they overtake and pass through the shock wave. The rate at which the velocity of the shock front accompanying the blast decreases is generally much greater than the decrease in velocity of fragments, which occurs due to air friction. Therefore, the advance of the shock front lags behind that of the fragments. The radius of effective fragment damage, although target dependent, thus exceeds consid-erably the radius of effective blast damage in an air burst.

Energy Storage
Let's assume non-rechargeable systems at an energy density of 2.5 kilojoules per cubic centimeter, which is quite plausible. You might consider a rechargeable battery pack as an option, with half the capacity of the non-rechargeables.
Lithium-polymer cells are rechargeable, and have an energy density of 1.08 kJ/cm3.
As for nonrechargable batteries, check out the various molten salt batteries. They're stored as a solid, so they can be stored 'charged' virtually forever. As soon as you bring them up to operating temperature (400 C or more), and as long as you keep them there, you have an incredibly high
output battery. The military has used them like this for a very long time, and most current research is focused on making them rechargeable.
Apparently the energy density varies widely, but it's clear that they can have very high energy density.

Whether you use lasers or particle beams, you'll need a kilojoule of output energy to reliably incapacitate a human target. In the case of a laser weapon, that energy would be subdivided into ~1 joule pulses at ~5 microsecond intervals, to achieve penetration in the face of a laser's natural tendency to deposit energy at the target's surface. Particle beams don't have that problem; boost the electrons up to a few hundred MeV, and you can dump the whole kilojoule's worth at once.
The plasma clears away easily in that time frame; debris is the real issue, and the driving force between the 5 microsecond pulse rate. That allows roughly 90% of the debris to clear the beam path, assuming a 1mm beam and instantaneous 1J pulses. 1 joule every 5 microseconds is optimal against soft tissue, other materials will want different pulse trains.
I'm assuming a weapon designed to penetrate ~30cm in soft body tissue. This gives about 15cm in bone or plastic, 5cm in brick or concrete, or 2.5cm in steel or most ceramics. Synthetics won't be very good at stopping energy weapons, even tough ones like kevlar, but you might be able to find a ceramic that could stop a laser beam with a centimeter's thickness or so. Particle beams are tougher to stop; it mostly comes down to sticking mass in the way without regard to material properties.
Lasers would likely have to have pulse energy and frequency tuned to the specific material being targeted. It might be possible to do this automatically, based on crude spectoanalysis of the material vaporized in each pulse, but if not expect penetration to be roughly halved if a laser weapon is fired at a target it has not been optimized for.
Taking into account the inefficiency of the system, the input energy will likely be somewhere between two and five kilojoules per shot. So you could get fifty to a hundred shots from a pistol-sized non rechargeable energy source, or half that with a rechargeable battery. Automatic fire at anywhere up to 20 Hz (1200 rpm) shouldn't be a problem in the short term, though might cause cooling problems if you keep it up.
You also need to focus the energy on the target, with a spot size of a millimeter or less. With a laser, that gets kind of tricky. A 5-centimeter mirror, about the largest you can really imagine on a pistol, gives an effective range of perhaps sixty meters, beyond which the weapon starts losing penetration quite rapidly.
you still need to get down to a millimeter or so to flash-boil water in a layer ~one optical depth in thickness. Once you do that, the steam will expand and spread the damage around, but if you don't hit the threshold for turning water into steam all you do is warm up the target.
With penetration, range, and repeatability dealt with, it is time to turn to accuracy. Lack of recoil, automatic fire capability, and line-of-sight accuracy are all major assets here, but there is one more improvement to be made. Both lasers and particle beams can be steered at least a degree or two off-axis, in the case of the laser via the adaptive-optic mirror, for particle beams with a transverse magnetic field at the muzzle.
If we can throw in a chip-mounted laser or acoustic gyro set, we can have a gyrostabilized handgun. The weapon shoots not at where the gun is pointed at the instant of firing, but at a weighted average of where it has been pointing over the past quarter of a second or so. Smoothes out a lot of the jitter inherent in human marksmanship.
Another clever one would be to use the laser's optics to project a laser sight. Pull the trigger, and the harmless red dot suddenly explodes. BANG! Using the laser optics as a scope would be more useful for long range or high accuracy shots.
In combat, I would expect such a weapon to be used in automatic fire mode at ~10 Hz. With fifty to a hundred pulses to play with, you won't run out of ammunition too soon as is the case with current machine pistols. And recoilless, stabilized automatic fire should allow a moderately capable marksman to walk a burst on target in one or two reaction cycles (say, half a second) in most circumstances.
Practical combat range, if you don't mind missing a good part of the time, would be on the order of 50 meters
Cooling:
And you'll need some serious cooling. I'd go with liquid-metal microchannel heat pipes etched into all the hot surfaces, and leading to cooling fins around the 'barrel'. If you use the chemical-propellant option, regenerative cooling could also work.
What would it sound like?
The actual mechanism of producing the laser beam could sound like anything, from complete silence, to the click of an electrical contact, to a sharp, electric snap, to a gunshot-like thunderclap.
The beam, when incident upon its target, will make a nice bang.
The pistol won't make a 'zap' sound, will it?
If the beam is repeated rapidly it might, however, make a buzz. It might end up sounding quite electrical at a few hundred Hertz.
Remember that the temporary cavity caused by the explosions only lasts a few milliseconds, so the beam has to have completed its work of piercing the target at this time. The individual explosions will be too closely spaced (microseconds apart) to be individually audible. Since shocks are always supersonic to the air in their path, and subsonic to the moving air left behind them, multiple subsequent shocks from the same source tend to merge into one stronger shock. Thus, each pulse probably makes one bang. The bang comes from a series of explosions whose total energy is about the same as that of the gunpowder detonating in a firing rifle, so it will probably be about as loud.
If the beam is in the visible part of the spectrum, you get a noticeable path through clean air at indoor lighting intensities. I am not sure if it will be visible out of doors under full sunlight, but you could see it at night. The beam will be widest at the aperture of the gun, probably a few centimeters across to keep the optics from being damaged by the intense light. The beam will converge to a spot a millimeter or so across at the target. In unclean air, the beam will be a lot more visible. This Rayleigh scattering is linear, so the total integrated brightness across the cross section of the beam should be constant, if we neglect the gradual attenuation of the beam due to the light being scattered out of it. Higher frequency light scatters much more than lower frequency light, so a blue beam would be much more visible than a red one.
When a visible beam is incident on the target, it creates a very bright flash of the same color as the beam. This may temporarily dazzle those looking at it, and the beam itself may be overlooked because of the bright flash obscuring it.
If the weapon lases in the UV, the intense pulse may cause multi-photon ionization of atoms in the air, causing a fluorescent glow along the path of the beam (possibly red, green, or violet, I'm not quite sure what sparsely ionized air at atmospheric pressure looks like). Since this process is non-linear, it will be dimmest near the aperture where the beam is widest, and most intense nearer the target. Weapon designers will probably try to minimize this effect, since it leads to attenuation of the beam and subsequent loss of effectiveness.
Near IR beams are likely to only be visible if there are relatively large pieces of dust, lint, or pollen floating around, which will glow incandescent as they burn under the irradiation of your beam. I doubt beams in the 'thermal' IR range would be used, even though the air is fairly transparent to these wavelengths, because with short, intense pulses you tend to get cascade ionization with these lower frequencies, and this will completely absorb the beam.
Beams at non-visible frequencies will also make a flash and a bang where incident on the target from the expanding plasma of their explosion, but nowhere near as bright as that of a visible beam.
In vacuum, of course, the beam itself is always invisible, but you can still see the flashes at the target.
Will the beam be invisible or bright enough to be blinding?
It is quite likely to be both. The beam itself may be invisible or minimally visible, but if even a tiny fraction of the beam is specularly scattered into your eye, near IR and visible and some near UV will be focused to a diffraction limited spot on your retina, causing burns and permanent scarring. This can lead to degradation of vision or total blindness. Interestingly, the brain compensates for blind spots on the retina, so that you might have lost up to 60% of your vision from multiple exposures to beams and you still think you can see just fine.
Anyone likely to be using a laser will probably wear protective goggles or contacts. With today's technology, you would probably make them out of an optical band gap material that excludes a very narrow window of light centered on the laser's frequency. This means that the people who fired the lasers would not be able to see the beams or flashes of their own weapons (assuming they used visible light lasers). They would still see the flashes from the plasma explosions, though, plus incandescence of suspended atmospheric particles and fluorescence from multi-photon absorption.
The method of subsequent explosions on the back of an expanding cavity driving the cavity through the target will leave a wound much like that of a gunshot, except without fun stuff like the bullet fragmenting or breaking up. A variant where nearly parallel beams a few cm apart literally rip the tissue between them could leave a wound looking more like an ugly gash - add on a few more of these beams on the same plane and you could literally cut someone in half with one millisecond pulse, using only about as much energy as goes into accelerating the bullet of a modern day battle rifle.
Will there be a large splash of blood and gore on the wall behind the unlucky pirate?
Quite likely, Note that since you do not have the momentum associated with a projectile, it will be more spread out than you would get from a gunshot wound, and you would get blood and gore coming out the front, too.
I assume that since the beam is one millimeter in diameter but the hole in the pirate is four centimeters, little or no wound cauterization will occur.
Nope, the wound would be ragged and messy. It is created by mechanical, not thermal effects.
The laser weapon will probably end up looking something like a camcorder, with a big lens that the beam goes through, and a fairly compact design. Since mirrors and internal optics can bend the beam inside the weapon, there is no need for the long barrels you see on modern firearms. Cooling, if necessary, would probably not involve fins - I would expect something more like the radiator on modern automobiles. Remember, shedding your heat through contact with the air is much more efficient than radiation.
keeping in mind that using contact with the air doesn't work if there is no air, i.e., in vacuum. C. James Huff notes that there is one kind of fin for radiant cooling and another for air cooling. He mentions that the fins on a CPU hot sink is a good example of the latter. For a vacuum rated laser he recommends a compressed or liquified gas cartridge since a radiant cooler would be inconveniently huge.
Also, lasers are getting surprisingly efficient. When each beam pulse contains no more energy than imparted to a rifle bullet, lasers might need cooling no more than a modern rifle.
the laser's battery will be carrying plenty of juice. Anything carrying that much energy will be at least slightly unstable. In other words, it wouldn't take much to make a charged battery into a home-made bomb (which might come in handy if one suddenly needed a bomb.). You might have read news reports about laptop computers who's batteries suddenly burst into flame.
And don't even think about sticking a fork into the open contacts.
This has been observed somewhat tongue-in-cheek by John Routledge as Routledge's Law: 'Any interesting battery material for a laser gun would be more usefully deployed as an explosive warhead.' He also notes the problem with ammunition cook off. If you are holding a fully-charged laser pistol, and some lucky enemy sniper manages to score a direct hit on the pistol's battery, it is going to be just to bad if the resulting explosion vaporizes you and all your friends within a large radius.
Assuming a worst case of 5 kilojoules per shot and a rechargeable magazine containing 50 shots, the magazine is packing 250 kilojoules. This is the equivalent of 250,000 * 2.7778e-4 = 70 watt-hours or 250,000 / 4,500 = 55 grams of TNT (For comparison purposes, a standard 8 inch stick of dynamite is about 208 grams and hand grenades used by the US Army have explosive charges of 56 to 226 grams of TNT). At his specified power density of 2.5 kilojoules per cubic centimeter, this would imply a magazine volume of 100 cm3. this is approximately the same volume as forty-two .45 caliber rounds.

Fan Beam
If a man is about 45 centimeters wide (18 inches), at a range of 5 meters, and the bolts were to be spaced 3 centimeters apart, it would take 15 bolts fired at 0.3 degree increments to the left and right. Your target would fall... in two places.
A less blood-thirsty use would be in the wilderness, chopping down trees ('Lumberjack' mode).

Multiple Modes
Stun would be a laser in Pulsed Energy Projectile mode.  Heat would be a laser in unpulsed heat ray mode at relatively low energy levels. Disrupt would be a laser in pulsed blaster mode or in unpulsed heat ray mode at high energy levels. Overload makes the battery explode. Dematerialize is the only one that cannot be done, but it is rather silly in the first place.
('Dematerialize' is a fancy way of saying 'disintegrator ray'. A weapon that can vaporize a human body without setting the walls and floor on fire or even raising the temperature of the room? Give me a break!)
Remember that a laser in pulse mode could have its effect optimized to a given material by a specific setting for pulse frequency. So one could have a 'metal cutting' setting for use as a tool or to open a locked door, and a 'kill human' setting for war-to-the-knife combat. All with the same pulse laser, just with a different frequency.
Such a weapon would have a selector switch for each mode. And it might have a 'customizable' mode. This would allow an expert to manually tweak the settings: continuous or pulse, spectrum frequency, pulse timing, power level, etc.

	<section name="Less Than Lethal">
		<reference>
			It was recently revealed that the US military was researching a rather alarming line of less-lethal
			weapons, the Pulsed Energy Projectile (PEP) program.  (As a side note, understand that there is no such
			thing as a 'non-lethal' weapon.  This is because any weapon or gas that can reliably incapacitate or render
			unconscious a 300 pound world wrestling champion will be strong enough to instantly kill a small child or
			elderly person.)  PEP weapons fire a laser pulse that is very intense but only a fraction of a second in
			duration.  The pulse vaporizes a tiny portion of the hapless victim's clothing or skin, creating a plasma
			burst intense enough to knock the victim to the ground.  This was intended to be used for crowd control.
			A pulse strong enough to knock one down is also strong enough to make one's eyeballs explode if it hit your
			face.  However, during test performed on animals, the researchers noticed something unexpected.  The pulses
			were creating pain and temporary paralysis in the test animals.  As it turns out, certain pulses would
			create a plasma burst emitting an electromagnetic signal of proper frequency to artificially stimulate the
			nerve endings in the animal's skin.  The US military is researching this effect, trying to find the
			frequency that will cause the maximum pain sensation without actually causing any physical harm to the
			target.  There is also the possibility that other frequencies could cause taser-like paralysis effects.
			The effect can be made lethal.  The original name for the project was Pulsed Impulsive Kill Laser (PIKL)
			but was quickly changed.  Currently PEP weapons are not man-portable, they are vehicle mounted weapons.
			They have a range of about two kilometers.  We might yet see Space-1999 style hand lasers with a "stun"
			setting.

Working from outside an opponent's effective range, Crane demands extreme technical proficiency and smooth footwork, as well as careful timing and judgment.

One who can use the power of Tiger, the mechanics of Mantis, the speed of Snake, the movements of Crane, and the cunning of Monkey.
					* As the dragon floats through the sky he twists and coils, flipping his tail as he turns. The dragon stylist uses turns and circular motions to throw and strike his opponents.
					* 'Ride the wind', a phrase which means follow rather than lead. Provide no opening without first letting your opponent open. Unlike Crane, which also relies heavily upon evasion as a tactic, the Dragon evades primarily by rotation of upper or lower torso with little or no stance movements, while the Crane stylist hops frequently to reposition the entire body. Both styles employ pinpoint strikes to vulnerable meridian targets, but dragon also heavily uses tiger-like punches and clawing techniques, snake-like stance shifts, and leopard-like hit and run strikes to weaken a physically superior adversary.  Dragon kung fu also regularly employs low sweeping techniques

The only time he shows he is hurt is when he is not. He acts like he is running away in order to come back with an attack on his own ground.
					* Blocking is wasted in Leopard - the style can be summed up with 'Why block when you can hit?' It does not rely on rooted stances, and would only assume a stance while in attack in order to launch at the opponent. This hit and run technique of the leopard, something especially effective against larger opponents, is unique to the animal.

The snake stylist, too, concentrates on waiting until the time is right and with his fingertips, strikes to a vital spot in a blink of an eye. Knowing how to use one's internal energy or chi is a major part of the snake system.
					* Snake is a soft style using an opponent's energy against them rather than resisting it. Snakes absorb, control and redirect rather than block an attack. Snake stylists are known for circular and whip-like motions flowing around opponents, climbing over their defenses and striking repeatedly in rapid succession. Snake is high, circular, soft and extremely fast, favoring progressive direct attacks that overwhelm a defense.
					* Snake style is based on whipping power which travels up the spine to the fingers. The ability to sinuously move, essentially by compressing one's stomach/abdominal muscles, is very important.

					* The primary weapons of the ninja are the ninja-to sword and shuriken throwing stars. They were also adept in many types of concealed weapons. They are also known for unusual gadgets to assist them in climbing, crossing water, picking locks, etc. They are assassins, so they are not interested in honorable combat and will use traps or poison instead of combat if possible.
					* Kunoichi - Female ninja operated as infiltrators, spies and assassins. They spent time in enemy houses, reported secrets and undermined rival houses by any means necessary. Kunoichi could use their gender to their advantage because women were underestimated as warriors. This made it easier for them to get closer to their targets by posing as maids, geisha, servants and priestesses. In some cases, they were taken on as concubines and mistresses, giving them unparalleled access to all their marks.

When he strikes, it is not the man but the sword in the hand of the man's subconscious that strikes. - Zen Master Takuan Soho

					The Red Leaves Cut means knocking down the enemy's long sword. The spirit should be getting control of his sword. When the enemy is in a long sword attitude in front of you and intent on cutting, hitting and parrying, you strongly hit the enemy's sword with the Fire and Stones Cut... If you then beat down the point of his sword with a sticky feeling, he will necessarily drop the sword. If you practise this cut it becomes easy to make the enemy drop his sword. - Miyamoto Mushashi, The Book of Five Rings

Sweep your eyes around broadly, carefully examining the attacking order, and cut left and right alternately with your swords. Waiting is bad. Always quickly re-assume your attitudes to both sides, cut the enemies down as they advance, crushing them in the direction from which they attack. Whatever you do, you must drive the enemy together, as if tying a line of fishes, and when they are seen to be piled up, cut them down strongly without giving them room to move. - Miyamoto Mushashi, The Book of Five Rings

					When the enemy attacks and you also attack with the long sword, you should go in with a sticky feeling and fix your long sword against the enemy's as you receive his cut.

It is best to approach as calmly as possible when hitting the enemy's long sword with stickiness. The difference between 'Stickiness' and 'Entanglement' is that stickiness is firm and entanglement is weak. - Miyamoto Mushashi, The Book of Five Rings

					* War hammers were developed as a consequence of the ever more prevalent metal armors of the medieval battlefields during the 14th and 15th centuries. Swords were of little use against these armors. The war hammer could deal blows of tremendous force to the target, especially when mounted on a pole, and by impact alone do damage without penetrating the armor. The spike end could be used for grappling the target's armour, reins, or shield, or could be turned in the direction of the blow to pierce even heavy armor. Against mounted opponents, the weapon could also be directed at the legs of the horse, toppling the armored foe to the ground where he could be more easily attacked.

					The Gaze
					* The gaze should be large and broad. This is the twofold gaze 'Perception and Sight'. Perception is strong and sight weak.
					* In strategy it is important to see distant things as if they were close and to take a distanced view of close things. It is important in strategy to know the enemy's sword and not to be distracted by insignificant movements of his sword. The gaze is the same for single combat and for large-scale combat.
					* It is necessary in strategy to be able to look to both sides without moving the eyeballs. You cannot master this ability quickly. Learn what is written here: use this gaze in everyday life and do not vary it whatever happens.

					The Five Attitudes
					* The five attitudes are: Upper, Middle, Lower, Right Side, and Left Side.  These are the five.
					* Although attitude has these five dimensions, the one purpose of all of them is to cut the enemy.
					* There are none but these five attitudes.
					* Whatever attitude you are in, do not be conscious of making the attitude; think only of cutting.

					* Middle Attitude - Confront the enemy with the point of your sword against his face.  When he attacks, dash his sword to the right and 'ride' it.  Or, when the enemy attacks, deflect the point of his sword by hitting downwards, keep your long sword where it is, and as the enemy renews the attack cut his arms from below.

					* When you master my Way of the long sword, you will be able to control any attack the enemy makes.  I assure you, there are no attitudes other than the five attitudes of the long sword of NiTo.

					* Upper Attitude - From the Upper attitude cut the enemy just as he attacks.  If the enemy evades the cut, keep your sword where it is and, scooping from below, cut him as he renews the attack.

					* You will always win with the five long sword methods. You must train repeatedly.

					* Lower Attitude - Adopt the Lower attitude, anticipating scooping up. When the enemy attackes, hit his hands from below.  As you do so, he may try to hit your sword down. If this is the case, cut his upper arm(s) horizontally with a feeling of 'crossing'. This means that from the Lower attitudes you hit the enemy at the instant that he attacks. You will encounter this method often, both as a beginner and in later strategy.
					* Left Side Attitude - Adopt the Left Side attitude. As the enemy attacks, hit his hands from below. If as you hit his hands he attempts to dash down your sword, with the feeling of hitting his hands, parry the path of his long sword and cut across from above your shoulder. Through this method you win by parrying the line of the enemy's attack.
					* Right Side Attitude - In the fifth approach, the sword is in the Right Side attitude. In accordance with the enemy's attack, cross your sword from below at the side to the Upper attitude. Then cut straight from above.
					* Cut and Slash - To cut and slash are two different things.  Cutting, whatever form of cutting it is, is decisive, with a resolute spirit. Slashing is nothing more than touching the enemy. Even if you slash strongly, and even if the enemy dies instantly, it is slashing. When you cut, your spirit is resolved. You must appreciate this. If you first slash the enemy's hands or legs, you must then cut strongly. Slashing is in spirit the same as touching. When you realise this, they become indistinguishable. Learn this well.

				<summary>
					A barrage is a line or barrier of exploding shells from a large number of guns firing continuously.  Its purpose is to deny or hamper enemy passage.  It contrasts with a concentration, in which all the guns aim at the same small area.

					The barrage was developed in World War I, with the infantry following the advancing barrage.  Its employment in this way recognised the importance of artillery fire in neutralising, rather than destroying, the enemy.  A creeping barrage immediately followed by an infantry assault could be far more effective than weeks of preliminary bombardment.

The hoplites had to trust their neighbors for mutual protection, so a phalanx was only as strong as its weakest elements. Its effectiveness depended on how well the hoplites could maintain this formation while in combat, and how well they could stand their ground, especially when engaged against another phalanx. The more disciplined and courageous the army, the more likely it was to win. The Greek word dynamis, the 'will' or 'ability to fight,' was used to express the drive that kept hoplites in formation.

A pilum, having penetrated a shield through a small hole and its shank having bent would now be difficult to remove. It is likely that the shaft would hit the ground and thus stop the charging enemy in his tracks. An enemy, if not killed by the pilum, would have little time before closing with the legionaries and would have to discard his now-unwieldy shield before going into combat. Additionally, bent pila would be less suitable for reuse by a resourceful opponent.

				* The main advantage of composite bows over self bows (made from a single piece of wood) is their combination of smaller size with high power. They are therefore much more suitable for use from horseback, and presumably from a chariot.
				* Constructing composite bows requires much more time and materials than self bows, and the animal glue traditionally used can lose strength in humid conditions and be quickly ruined by submersion. For most practical non-mounted archery purposes, composite construction offers no advantage; 'the initial velocity is about the same for all types of bow, the design parameters appear to be less important than is often claimed.' However, their compact size make them superior for horsemen.

				* Star Mines are basically Star Torpedoes that have been left floating in space near likely enemy traffic. The mines are smart and will only attack selected targets and can act as spy satellites by transmitting what their sensors are picking up. When given the order, the Star Mine rockets off toward its victim. Though inefficient in space because of the vast distances, they still can be effective by limiting an opponent's options or when used as traps at key locations.
