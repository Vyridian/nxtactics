	<section name="Why Tactics: Advanced Rules?">
		<summary>
			The Tactics:Basic Rules are sufficient for running a board game, but they lack detail when simulating a specific genre. The Tactics system is designed to allow different sets of rules to be plugged into the basic rules on an ala carte basis. This Advanced Rule book provides many of the optional rules necessary to increase realism or pseudo-realism. The other genre-based rule books will add rules that are specific to each genre.

		<summary>
			* Strike First - Units are immediately penalized for damage taken, so do unto others before they do unto you.
			* Maintain a Threat - The battlefield changes with each unit's move, so use pawns to control the map while saving powerful and valuable units until later in the Round.  If you are not careful your opponent will surround and eliminate your units that have already acted.
			* Hold the Line - Opportunity and Hold Off abilities are deadly and allow you to protect weaker units.
			* Use the Terrain - Cover and abilities linked to cover offer an outstanding defense that layers with normal defense. The difference is most pronounced with lesser units. Effective use of terrain will determine the victor in most battles.

				* [Action]: A unit with Hidden tokens is not actually at the location shown by its unit marker.
				* [Defense]: Any unit that can see the unit marker may spend an [Action] to attempt to attack or locate the unit. This is done by the unit secretly choosing the actual location of the unit up to the number of Hidden tokens away from the unit marker where the unit lies (note: the target location may not be passed a barrier that the unit could not cross with normal movement). The opponent then tries to guess both direction and distance. The unit then reveals its actual position and moves its unit marker there. If both are guessed, the unit is discovered and loses all Hidden tokens. If either is guessed, the unit loses 1 Hidden token. If the unit has no Hidden tokens, resolve the attack normally. If the unit has Hidden tokens then the unit remains hidden and any attack fails unless it is an area effect and the unit is the effect.

			<summary>
				* Experience allows a unit to gain permanent ability increases.
				* Something major must be on the line, such that if the character fails he will incur a significant loss (e.g. a valuable item, his life). This is why characters seek out high stakes gambles and are not satisfied unless a great deal is on the line.
				* The character must face an opponent or difficulty no more than 1 level below his own or he must declare he is using the [Honor System].
    * Minor Achievement - Gain an [Latent Ability] 2 levels below your highest level (minimum 1).
    * Major Achievement - Gain a [Latent Skill] 2 levels below your highest level (minimum 1).

  </rule>
		<rule name="Gain a Skill/Power, Ability/Specialty">
			<summary>
				* In order to gain a new ability, a user must perform research, practice, and experimentation.
				* Each week of practice and experimentation, the user may draw a Fate card.
    ** If the Fate is a critical it is successful and may do EITHER of the following:
    *** Gaining a Skill/Power - The user may convert a [Latent Skill] to a Skill or Power (if
    allowed) of equal level.
    *** Gaining an Ability/Specialty - The user may convert or [Latent Ability] into an
    actual Ability or Specialty on an equal level.
				* Training Area/Laboratory - +1 Die if a dedicated training area with
				appropriate resources is available.
				* Assistants - Assistants reduce the difficulty of a task as well as allowing
				them to learn on the job. See [Followers].
				* Mentor - +1 Die if a mentor is available.
				* Experimentation - Trial and error can produce some fascinating or useless random results.
				* Invention - Permanent Devices and Enchantments can be created over time.
				** Cost - Great care and cost must be expended to obtain or create an item of
				sufficient quality to hold an enchantment.
				** Difficulty - Inventions may be created instead of acquiring a new ability.
				** Time

		<rule name="Honor System">
			<summary>
				* Normally a character cannot gain experience from a foe more than 1 level
				below his own. If a character wants to gain experience against such a lower
				level foe, he must declare that he wants to compete 'On His Honor' using the
				Honor System.
				* The Honor System basically allows a character to metaphorically (or
				literally) fight an opponent with one hand tied behind his back.
				* The character must challenge the opponent to a 'fair fight'. The challenge
				makes the fight formal to any observers and places the character's honor
				squarely on the line.
				* The character must offer some special incentive if the opponent wins (e.g.
				a special treasure, his daughter's hand in marriage, safe passage for his
				opponents, not invading the Earth, his own head on a pike, etc.)
				* For the duration of the challenge, others must not interfere.
				* For the duration of the challenge, the character must refrain from using
				any skills that are more than 1 level higher than the opponent's defense.
				Further he must limit his own defense rolls to 1 more than the opponents
				skill.
				* If the opponent or his allies breaks these terms, the challenge is void.
				* If the character or his allies breaks these terms, it is a serious blow to
				the honor of the character and he immediately loses one level from one of his
				highest skills.
				* If the character wins the competition, he may gain experience normally
				against this opponent.

			Carrier Command is a set of rules for use with units that hold other units in a [Hanger].

			Common Actions
			* Enter or Exit Hanger - Move and Action (Unit): Place a unit from the [Hanger] on the [Flight Deck] OR from the [Flight Deck] to the [Hanger].
			Only 1 unit may be on the [Flight Deck] at any given moment and may be targetted normally there.
			* Launch or Land - Move and Action (Unit): Move a unit onto or off of the [Flight Deck].  If the carrier has a [Launch Catapult], a launching
			unit gains +2 movement.
			* Dive Bomb - Action: -4 Altitude and drop bombs attacking the top of the target creating [Fire] and damaging weapons, crew, and [Flight Deck].
			Normally only the target and opposing aircraft can [Interrupt] before the bombs are dropped.  Can only be performed from exactly +5 Altitude
			and with no [White Tokens].
			* Torpedo Bomb - Action: Drop torpedo attacking a side of the target below the water line creating [Flooding] and damaging [Speed].  Can only be
			performed from exactly +1 Altitude and with no [White Tokens].
			* Landing - Move and Action (Unit): Move a unit and place it on the [Flight Deck].  Only 1 unit may be on the [Flight Deck] at any given moment
			and may be targetted normally there.
			* Refuel or Reload - Move and Action (Unit): Any unit on the [Flight Deck] or in the [Hanger] may refuel OR reload weapons (changing weapons if
			desired).
