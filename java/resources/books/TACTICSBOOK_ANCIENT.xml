		<summary>
			Roman Legions were the official fighting force of the empire and were divided in the following way:

			* Each Legion consisted of 4800 men
			* Each Legion was divided into 10 cohorts of 480 legionaries
			* Each Cohort was divided into 6 centuries of 80 men each.  The 6 centuries were: Forward Hastati, Rear Hastati,
			Forward Pricipes, Rear Pricipes, Forward Triarii, and Rear Triarii.
			* Each Century was divided into 10 octets of 8 men.  Soldiers of an octet shared a tent, and were rewarded or
			punished together.  If one member acted dishonorably in battle, that contubernium would suffer
			decimation, whereby the group would be required to draw straws, the soldier unlucky enough to draw the short straw
			then being stoned to death by the others.

				or to shock the enemy with a different look at the right moment.  If the heavy infantry were pushed
				back, the Triarii would charge forward with their spears, hopefully with the effect of shocking the
				enemy and allowing the Princeps and Hastati time to regroup.  They were used as a last resort, and the
				Latin expression 'ad triarios redisse', or it has come to the triarii, became a general phrase meaning
				that something was in a desperate situation.

			Roman Auxilia are support troops and specialized units.  By the 2nd century, the auxilia contained the same number of
			infantry as the legions and in addition provided almost all the Roman army's cavalry and more specialised troops
			(especially light cavalry and archers).  The auxilia thus represented three-fifths of Rome's regular land forces.
			Like their legionary counterparts, auxiliary recruits were mostly volunteers, not conscripts, but unlike the legion
			the auxilia accepted non-Romans (which represented 90% of the empire).

Examples of Play
Romans vs. Greeks
Combat Example:

Combat Cards:
Surprise
Use when:
	Opponent must be unaware
Effects:
	+4 Attack
	Opponent can only defend

Hold Off
Use when:
	Longer Reach
	In Melee Combat
	Not in Close Combat
Effects:
	First Strike
	+2 Attack
	+4 Damage Vs Charge
	Opponent cannot move into Close Combat if you hit.

Charge:
Effect:
Use when:
	Not in Melee Combat
Effect:
	Full Move Attack
	+2 Damage
	Moves into Close Combat

Guard:
Effect:
	+2 Defense
	All hits taken are shield hits

Example:
Human attacks the Orc in the open.
The Orc has longer reach an chooses Hold Off.
The Human is wary of the spear and plays Guard and Close Combat.

Round 1:
Orc roll: 12 + 9 Spear + 2 Hold Off = 23
Human roll: 9 + 8 Sword + 2 Guard - 1 Encumberance = 18

Orc scores a hit for 5 + 3 Spear = 8 Damage

Guard makes the damage a shield hit.
Determine hit location.
8 (Piercing) - 3 (Shield) - 3 (Armor) = 2 (Piercing) Wound.

Body reduces by 2 to 10 not enough to change bonus.

The successful Hold Off means the Human's Close Combat Movement fails.
