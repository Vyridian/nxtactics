motives vary, but they are united in these common goals.

Their reward is a greater acceptance and aid from the public, police, and other heroes.

of superbeings.  Unlike the military, clandestine groups are not particularly effected by superbeings since their
work is generally more subtle.  Security, however, is difficult to maintain with powerful beings with telepathic
and stealh powers roaming the world.

* Conquer the World - Become so powerful that none can stand against you.
* Blackmail - Destroy cities unless their demands are met.
* Heist - Money is almost as strong a motivator for villians as power.
* Having Fun - Villians enjoy their power and are not afraid to use it.  Vandalism and displays of power give some
villians a particular thrill.
* Matching Wits - Some of the most egotistical villians feel that their victories would be too easy without pitting
their own abilities against the heroes, and will actually tip their hands to force a confrontation.
* Death Trap - Villians hate to see a hero die too quickly.  Better to let them fully comprehend their defeat
before they die.
* Threatening Innocents - This is a favorite of villians as it underscores the difference between the heroes heroes
and the villians.  Some villians, however, find hiding behind bystanders to be cowardly.
* Playing Possum - Often a villian may seem defeated, but often have a last trick up their sleeve.
* Killing Allies - Villians love to punish their own.  It shows how evil they are and is a great way to motivate
others by showing the price of failure or rebellion.
* Monologing -
* Escape Routes - Villians somehow manage to escape certain death on a regular basis.  They are always well
prepared, and they also seem almost as lucky as the heroes.")))))

Rom's armor can withstand temperatures from 8000 degrees Fahrenheit to -350 degrees Fahrenheit, and is a sealed,
vacuum tight, seamless shell (including articulation).  His armor is capable of withstanding ballistic impacts of
up to large antitank weaponry, and overpressures of up to 40 pounds per square inch (the equivalent of the blast
effects of 1000 pounds of TNT at the range of 100 feet) without damage.
Rom's natural organs within his armor were augmented by automated micro-functioning circuitry.  Rom's cyborg form
was designed with numerous sites of redundancy programming so that his body could not lose his various abilities
through damage or malfuntion.

WEAPONS: As a Spaceknight, Rom made use of two weapons.

The first, his Energy Analyzer, was his primary means of identifying the presences of the shape-shifting Dire Wraiths.  When Rom suspected these aliens were in his vicinity, he withdrew the Analyzer from its pocket in hyperspace and scanned the suspected Wraiths.

The Energy Analyzer emits a beam of ultra high frequency waves that enable it to detect the molecular structure of any object it is focused upon. To detect Dire Wraiths, the Analyzer stimulates certain rare earth elements found within the alien's body and causes those elements to emit radio frequencies visible to Rom's visor sensors. Thus, with the use of the Analyzer, Rom could recognize any Wraith no matter what form they had taken.

The Analyzer can also scan and analyze the energy fields of non-Wraiths, such as superhuman mutant Earth human beings. By electronic impulses, the Analyzer informed Rom of the individual's power potential of the subject it was scanning. Rom also used the Analyzer to trace the energy trails of certain powerful beings, such as his fellow Spaceknight Starshine.

The Analyzer has no offensive powers; it is a device of detection only. However, the scanning process, which bathes the subject in an eerie red energy field, has been known to unnerve certain beings.

Rom's chief offensive weapon was his Neutralizer, the most powerful device ever developed on the planet of Galador. The Neutralizer's main function is to neutralize any type of energy field that it encounters. The Neutralizer was developed as a means of defeating the alien Dire Wraiths with out actually killing them. When focused upon a Wraith, the Neutralizer emits a ray of such intense power that it neutralizes all energy about the alien. Such a disruption in the energy field causes a transtemporal rift to open up between our dimension and the realm called limbo. The Wraith is then sucked through the portal into limbo. The energy needed to neutralizer a Wraith is not the maximum energy level attainable. At extreme power the Neutralizer will kill a Wraith by disrupting all of its vital functions. Rom was traditionally reluctant to use this setting.

Rom had only to think of the power level he desired, and cybernetic impulse in his armor recalibrated the weapon. At low setting the Neutralizer is capable of neutralizing the life threatening effects of radiation poisoning. However, at a more powerful setting, the Neutralizer will easily negate the life force of a living being, killing him. Rom has never used the Neutralizer to kill a human being. A human being cannot be transported to limbo because his physiology would not survive the neutralization effect.

Because of its enormous potential for destruction, the Neutralizer is equipped with several safety devices to insure that none save Rome will ever utilizer its power. The Neutralizer would automatically destroy any device used to activate the Neutralizer without Rom's thought patterns. (However, the Spaceknight Dominor somehow used the Neutralizer to destroy himself.)

Rom kept his Analyzer and Neutralizer in a pocket in sub-space (hyperspace) from which he could retrieve it using his dimensional hole generator."

               "* Life-Force Absorption: by psionically draining the life forces of other human beings into herself, by physical touch. If she drained a person's entire life force from him or her, the victim dies and the victim's body crumbles into dust. It is unknown how often Selene must drain life force from another human in order to survive. It is known, that great expenditure of power causes Selene to age, but she can rejuvenate herself by absorbing more life force. Selene will not age as long as she maintains her supply of absorbed life force.
* Psychic Vampire: If Selene drains only part of a victims life force, Selene achieves a measure of psychic control over her victim's mind. Through unknown means, Selene can cause a human being to become a psychic vampire like herself, but be subordinate to Selene's own will.
* Physical Enhancement: Selene has physical strength, stamina, speed, and reaction time that are all several times greater than those of a normal woman.
* Superhuman Speed: ability to momentarily move at speeds rivaling those of Quicksilver.
* Shadow-Morphing: allowing her to dematerialize or use solid tendrills of darkness to manipulate objects
* Telekinetic Animation: can cause inanimate objects to move according to her will by projecting part of her absorbed life force into them.
* Inanimate Disintegration: She can cause inanimate objects in her presence to disintegrate. She cannot, however, rearrange the atomic or molecular structure of matter.
* Pyrokinesis: can psionically generate and project intense heat and flame from and around her body or direct it at certain distances. She was also able to manipulate flame created from other sources and could magnify their intensity or snuff them. The flames Selene generated could also be illusory in effect; for example, she could focus the power on an object making it appear to be on fire while it was not being damaged by the flames at all. Selene instinctively created a psionic force field about her entire body that protected her from the effects of the heat and flame she created and from other sources as well
* Telepathy: capable of displaying various psionic feats with the minds of others including reading and communicating with thoughts over vast distances.
* Psi-Screen: possesses a psychic mental shield to protect her from psychic attacks.
* Mental Bolts: can project psionic force bolts which have no physical effects but which can affect a victim's mind so as to cause the victim pain or unconsciousness.
* Hypnotic Trance: can induce a momentary hypnotic trance state in people around her. Often used along with her speed to create the illusion of teleportation.
* Immortal: her aging process is greatly retarded and she can apparently regenerate injured or missing cells from even near-fatal injuries.
* Rapid Healing: ability to endure injuries (within unknown limits) without lasting harm or even feeling pain such as knife wounds.
* Sorcery: possesses considerable magical abilities, having gained a great deal of mystical knowledge over the millennia. The number of magical effects that she can create has yet to be cataloged, but it is known that she can cast and counteract spells and summon extra-dimensional demons. Selene appears to age as she uses magic.

              :summary
               "Alex's most obvious powers are his superhuman strength, speed and durability (both disease and physical).  He is strong enough to lifts cars, helicopters, and tanks and throw them with casual ease.
* Alex is also very fast and agile.
* He can achieve running speeds surpassing cars around 40-50 mph.
* He can achieve a vertical jumping height of 8-10 stories and can leap across a whole city block.
* He is durable enough to survive direct hits from hellfire missiles and tank shells.
* He also seems completely unaffected from falls; even ones from the top levels of skyscrapers.
* He has displayed regenerative abilities powerful enough to allow him to reform from being turned to mush from a nuclear blast, so long as there is some source of biomass to absorb.
* Alex can also see in both Thermal and Infected Vision.
* He can absorb organic matter of living creatures.  This provides him with not only a boost to his health, but also allows him to access and utilize any knowledge, experience, memories or skills that his prey possessed.  He can manipulate his own biomass into concentrated areas on his body for a number of weapons, a shield, or even full body armor.
* Claws - Alex shifts his Biomass into a 3 fingered, 1 thumbed talon-like appendages that he uses to shred flesh and bone, cutting both the Infected and Military in half with a single sweep in some cases. The Claws are best used as a well rounded anti-infantry weapon.
* Groundspike - When used, it causes spikes of biomass to rise up from underneath the ground and impale anyone unfortunate enough to be caught in the radial area of damage.
* Hammerfists - Hammerfists are a primarily anti-vehicle or anti-crowd power. By shifting large amounts of biomass towards his hands, Alex can create large hammer-like weapons that are excellent at crushing both vehicles and infantry. Although best served as an anti-vehicle weapon because of its slow speed yet powerful strikes, it is also quite useful against hunters. If the Player charges up his punch, he can knock one enemy horizontally into another and kill two birds with one stone. The Hammerfist can be used as a four strike combo that shatters the street and knocks all ground targets in range.
* Hammer Toss - allows Alex to hurl himself across a distance, destroying everything in his path.
* Blade - Alex grows an elongated double ended blade from his elbow onward, turning his arm into a giant razor sharp blade. Alex can perform a special attack to take out all targets within range in a flurry of moves leaving only a spray of blood and chunks of flesh. The Blade Arm can be upgraded to have an attack to drop from the air with tremendous force able to crush a hunter or tank in one hit. Another upgrade gives you the ability to run and pull a chain of hits off that allows for quick runs through a crowd leaving bodies and gore behind.
* Whipfist - The Whipfist is one of many abilities Alex Mercer has at his disposal, and the weapon of choice when opposed by the recurring Helicopters the Player encounters. The Whipfist is an extremely useful ability for hijacking them while staying in the air. However, the Whipfist can be used as a weapon, useful for clearing out large groups of enemies when Alex becomes surrounded. The Whipfist, along with the Groundspike ability and Devastator, is the only real ranged power Alex can use (aside from Military firearms) and is pretty much a razor sharp tentacle that can lash out and cut enemies in half. The Whipfist is also capable of cutting through crowds of enemies in seconds. The Whipfist is able to grab enemies, civilians and vehicles from range, and sling them great distances. This can be combined with 'Skyjacking' (hijacking a helicopter in mid-air) in which you grab hold of a helicopter at range, pull yourself in and assume control of it.
* Tendril Barrage Devastator - Massive amounts of tendrils made of biomass erupts from within Alex's body that impales everything around him, then brings back some material. Wide area of affect, and excellent against numerous organic enemies (hunters, humans, infected). It is rather ineffective against armor.
* Graveyard Spike Devastator - Creates huge spikes from the ground that impale everything around Alex, very similar to the Groundspike move. Very effective against armored targets, humans and infected.
* Critical Pain Devastator - A hard mass of tissue is formed from Alex's hands and is fired as a powerful beam of biomass. Can only effect things in the firing line, but has a long range and is catastrophic to everything in the way, exploding tanks in one hit."

He is completely ruthless and will kill or sacrifice others without hesitation. His intense mind control abilities have caused his social skills to falter, so he is generally rude, obnoxious, impatient, and bossy.
* PSI - Over the centuries, The Will has formed various clinics, schools and asylums to gain test subjects, servants, and soldiers. With the rise of super powered beings, he has formed the Parapsychological Studies Institute to recruit and study vulnerable superbeings under the guise of helping them with their abilities.
* Renegades - Using the PSI, The Will has enlisted a loosely coordinated team of killers to do his bidding. It is ironic that they call themselves the Renegades since they are so tightly controlled by The Will. Since The Will has no regard for others, he treats the Renegades as disposable cannon fodder. Because of this, the Renegades suffer from a lack of discipline, training, loyalty, and coordination. Windshear leads the team and attempts to counter these weaknesses, but the team remains hopelessly disorganized group of argumentative individuals instead of a tightly knit team.
* Born January 5th the year of our Lord, 1107 AD, Hieronymous Faust was a gifted boy. He went to war as a young man in what is now eastern France. During a raid on a castle, he discovered the resident alchemist had discovered a partial solution to aging. He spared the alchemists life in exchange for servitude. For the next 20 years, they worked together. Some experiments were successful, but always they were inconsistent. The alchemist died, and Hieronymous continued working into old age. Finally, he decided that success or failure depended on the will of the subject. With an intensity born of fear of his imminent death, he performed his final experiments upon himself. Whatever the cause, his efforts succeeded. His aging came to a halt at 75 though he must always remain focused or he will continue to age. He cannot even allow himself to sleep anymore. Years past and his willpower grew stronger. He began to mentally dominate others to his 'Will' while searching for a way to return to a younger age. He has made many partial successes, but over time has always returned to his current state."

* Powers
** Spinning - Marina can twist her body around at tremendous speeds almost faster than the eye can follow. While spinning, she continuously orients her face forward using her ballet skills.
** Ranged - While spinning she can use knives to tear into people or to hurl them with tremendous force.
** Melee - Her costume has hidden blades throughout, especially in her skirt which has long metal blades down their length that point outward when she spins like a buzzsaw.
** Armor - While spinning, her skin hardens causing her to appear like porcelain. Her spinning body als deflects attacks. Both effects provide her surprising resistance to damage.
* Personality - Marina craves attention and without the adoration of the crowds, she has unfortunately found satisfaction in the looks of shock and horror that accompany her deadly rampages. This negative feedback loop has made her increasingly cruel and viscious. She has become a rampaging lunatic like a 	killer in a horror movie. Of course, the influence of The Will has done nothing to improve her mental state.
* History - Marina Rovani was born to wealthy Russian parents in St. Petersburg. She has always shown amazing physical grace and athleticism. She began strict ballet training at 6 years old and began performing professionally at age 10. She grew to become a child media sensation in her mother Russia. By 16, she was performing with the Mariinsky Ballet company in St. Petersburg. During one of her performances, her twirls became incredibly fast, obviously faster than an ordinary human could achieve. Her mutant talents had become visible in a highly public way. A firestorm of controversy erupted, fuelled by jealous rivals. The ballet company let her go, and she became a pariah in the conservative ballet circles that were her only life. Marina confronted the company heads and flew into a petulent rage. When they dismissed her and promised that she would never work again, Marina, who was never a well-balanced child had a psychotic break. She began to twirl at incredible speeds and tore through the building. She killed 10 and wounded dozens more. She was locked in an asylum until [The Will] had her transferred to his institute."

** Healing - Arc can heal at an accelerated rate when not using other abilities.
** Agility - Arc can move with stunning speed and precision for short periods.
** Arc Lash - Arc can channel energy into conducting wire turning it into a blinding whip of lightning. He has fine control over the shape and orientation of the Arc Lash. It can change shape at will and strikes like a lightning bolt. The Arc Lash is fast enough to parry bullets. Arc is able to use even large or long wires as weapons.
** Arc Sword - Arc can channel energy into any sheet metal he touches, twisting it into a blinding sword of lightning. The Arc Sword is weightless to him, so he can create absurdly large weapons with the right materials. He does not normally carry metal for an Arc Sword preferring to scrounge on the battlefield for something large.
** Arc Shield - Like the Arc Sword, he can twist sheet metal into blinding shields or walls of lightning. Any size metal will do, including cars.
** Arc Lance - Arc can channel energy into any solid metal object and wield it like a blinding spear/staff of lightning. His power makes the Arc Lance weightless to him, so he can use even use iron girders as weapons.
* Skills - Arc has trained with whips, blades, spears, and staves as well as wrestling and kickboxing.  He is also a skilled welder and electrician. Since gaining his powers, he has dabbled in metal sculpture.
* Equipment - Arc wears a arc welders mask that he has converted into a helmet for protection. He also wears a modified military flak suit. He always carries a number of wire spools in his pockets for Arc Lashes.
* History - Javier Manzano is an Ecuadoran immigrant who was working as a construction welder on the Zakum bridge in Boston when a sudden storm rolled in. Before he could escape, the bridge was struck by a massive series of lightning bolts. For the next twenty minutes, hundreds of thousands of volts passed through him and his arc welding gear. When he was found, he was badly burned over 80% of his body. Over the next two days, he flatlined multiple times only to immediately recover when the defibrulator was used. He awoke in the hospital days later, where he found that despite his injuries he was filled with energy and that he was healing at an astounding rate. Further, the monitoring equipment attached to him began to malfunction, sometimes spectacularly."

* Powers - His magical powers give him control over wind and birds, specifically crows and ravens. As a shapeshifter, he has enhanced regeneration especially when he changes form. In all forms, he can 	magically speak the languages of birds and has subtle control over winds. He gains other powers in different forms.
* Crow Form: He can fly and regenerate and is far more durable than a normal crow or human. He can speak in simple sentences in a similar way to a normal raven. Like a raven, he also has excellent eyesight especially for shiny things which can sometimes lead to distraction. Unfortunately, his intelligence is greatly reduced in this form.
* Giant Crow Form: In this form, he looks like a crow that has grown to the size of an eagle. In this form, he is a natural predator and can fly for extended periods before diving to attack at high speeds. A dive can also be a deadly lead-in to a shift into Warbird form.
* Human Form: Normal human form though his intelligence is the highest in this form.
* Feathered Human Form: In this form, he appears as a short man wearing a red mask with a long nose. He also appears to be wearing a bulky, black, feathered cape. This cape, however, is his folded wings, and he is not wearing a mask. This form is his most magically powerful. He can command birds, levitate and fly (awkwardly). In this form, he can summon intense winds, throw deadly feathers and can summon and command huge numbers of magical crows that are immune to his winds and will always fight to the 	death. His intelligence is moderately lower in this form, but he remains very shrewd and aware.
* Crinos/Warbird Form: In this form, he is an huge, terrifying, feathered bird creature. His body is jet black and rippling with power while his mind is clouded with rage. His feathers, beak and talons are insanely strong and sharp. In combat, he mostly uses his wings like massive claws, spears, or 	shields and hurls feathers like machine gun fire. In this form, he also regenerates at an exceptional rate. Crows that were already summoned continue to fight for him, but he can no longer control them or the winds except to aid his flight. He can fly nearly as fast as a jet fighter and possesses extreme agility in the air."

His research explores the unique skin of salamanders. This includes regeneration, neurotoxins, moulting, skin respiration, and mucus secretion. So far, he has discovered promising reductions of the neurotoxins that could help seizures, anxiety or hyperactivity. While searching for salamanders, a rotten tree fell on top of him, crushing his legs and pinning him in the marsh for two days before he was found. After his legs were amputated, he redoubled his focus on regeneration. Months later, he was shocked to discover that his skin texture was changing and he was losing his hair. Later he discovered his legs were regenerating. Not only that, the rate of regeneration was accelerating. He immediately returned to his home in New Jersey and Galion Pharmaceuticals to study his condition. Over time, his legs completely grew back and he discovered increasing changes to his celluar structure. His bones were softening and his skin began secreting mucous. It was obvious that his body had been infected in some way by the salamanders he had worked with. Further analysis showed that he was suffering from a retrovirus that transitioned from a salamander. He expected his degenerative condition to be fatal, but it turned out to be quite the opposite.

               "* Strand is a professional mystic, healer, and cult leader. He is extremely gifted and charges high prices to his elite clientele.
* Appearance - Strand is tall, thin and handsome. His eyes are a piercing green/hazel. He has short black dishevelled hair and his facial hair has an unshaven look. He generally wears a white button down shirt, black pants, and black shoes. In Coventry, he wears a loose robe over his clothes that indicates his rank. Outside he wears a long black raincoat that billows unnaturally around him with his every move. When he engages in combat, he materializes the Shroud of Uncertainty around him.
* Personality - Strand is young, striking, and arrogant in his power. He considers non-occultists to be simple livestock to be used and discarded without regard. He is an opium addict and has experimented extensively in every form of drug, vice or taboo. Privately he is intensely jaded finding little pleasure in earthly existence, seemingly waiting for some grand event that has yet to occur.
* History - Strand was raised by his father, Daedalus, a drug addict and occult practioner. His father travelled the world to increase his occult powers through forbidden knowledge and mind expanding drugs. Strand became an addict at age 8 and was institutionalized at age 16 for acute paranoid delusions. After his father died of an overdose, Strand immediately began to recover. Three months later he was released fully cured. Strand inherited his father's estate and immediately continued in his father's footsteps.
* The Coven - Despite his hauty attitude or because of it, many people are drawn to him. Strand maintains a select cult of fanatically loyal servants who serve his every whim in exchange for mystic training, knowledge, healing, and mind altering experiences.
* Conventry - Strand maintains an aging mansion deep in the woods. The building is a maze of massive rooms that seems to defy the exterior size. Most of these rooms are actually in the Spirit World.
* Powers
** Shroud of Uncertainty - Enchantment that makes the caster very difficult to harm. When attacked the caster appears to be hit by the full force of the attack, but this is an alternate reality that immediately fades.
** Anyone tracking or researching the wearer will discover multiple conflicting alternate reality trails. Such information is largely useless.
** Ties that Bind - Strand is partially possessed by his father's spirit. This connection grants him a high level of magical resistence.
** Threads of Fate - Those with spiritual or mental powers can see silvery-red cords of spirit rising from every part of his body and disappearing somewhere above him. These cords are reminiscent of puppeteer string as if he is being manipulated by an unseen force. He can cause similar cords to appear between himself and a target. When these cords touch a target, he can exert his will over them to immobilize, influence or control them. They are particularly effective against those with repressed aspects of their personality that he can unleash with his ability. This ability can only effect targets that can make decisions or are based on randomness (includes most computer programs).
** Reanimated - Strand has already died and been reanimated with Necromancy. His body is much tougher than normal and is highly resistant to damage. He can still bleed, but blood loss does not negatively affect him except that his appearance becomes more corpse-like. He no longer needs to breathe and he is highly resistant to radiation. He if vulnerable to dismemberment, fire, silver and purifying magic. He does not heals normally, but he can be repaired with Necromancy, at a price of course.
** Necromancy - Necrotic Repair, Reanimate
** Summoning - 
** Levitation - The Silver Cords can lift him off the ground and he can float at normal movement speeds."

* She is at once alien and empathetic having experienced every aspect of human existence over her long 'life'."

               "* Senturion is a highly advanced, alien construct with the thought patterns of a human super-imposed upon his programming. He originally believed that he was a young man who could transform into a robot, but he has since learned that his actual body died long ago and that his personality is just an artificial duplicate. After this discovery, his humanity has gradually diminished over time.
* Synthetic - Senturion does not need to eat, sleep or breathe. He is composed of molecular machines that twist and wrap in layers of ceramic wire filaments. These multipurpose filaments reconfigure into different forms to heal or create custom weapons. These filaments must always remain connected to the main body or they self-destruct to maintain their secrets. If Senturion loses a limb, the resulting explosion can cause significant damage.
* Body - He has tremendous strength and endurance and can withstand extreme temperatures, pressures, and the vacuum of space. His body is very flexible, and he can contort himself to escape confinement of fit through small gaps.
* Mind - His computer brain greatly increases his ability to quickly process information and create complex strategies.
* Speed - Senturion moves and reacts with lightning speed and precision. He can run at 80mph and can briefly run on walls. His graceful movements belie his great strength and significant weight.
* Leaping - Senturion can jump 40ft in the air.
* Eyes - Senturion's eyes can emit tight-beam lasers or a white sheet of explosive energy. He can sense electromagnetic radiation (including infrared and ultraviolet). He also possesses telescopic and microscopic vision.
* Transformation - As Mech-Man he was able to transform from a human-like form to his mechanical form. He has since lost this ability (and a great deal of his human personality). As Senturion he has refined this power to produce specialized weapons like blades and spikes.
* Healing - Senturion's android body rapidly repairs itself.
* Filaments - In close combat, filaments can emerge from its body which can scramble or override electrical devices on contact.
* History - Senturion was designed as one of a multitude of multi-purpose exploratory probes. Their natural form is a squirming mass of clear filaments. These probes were packed into artificial comets and launched in all directions from their homeworld. To protect their designers, they possess no memory of their origin or ultimate purpose. Many of these probes have landed on all planets in the solar system and millions more are littered across the galaxy. Most were buried underground by their impact and there they lie dormant. The ones on the surface seek a power source to fuel their growth and adaptation to their environment. They absorb light, heat, electricity or other radiation. When fully charged, they quietly begin exploring and analyzing their environment for possible resources and threats. If the planet is lifeless, they will catalog the available resources and begin creating more identical probes. If the planet is inhabited, they will wait and study the local wildlife until they are confident that they can completely mimic a sample of the apex species. Then they will begin to blend into the local society to learn everything they can. When their analysis no longer produces significant results, they begin to create more probes. Though they are unaware of their creator or purpose, they continue to catalog and expand. Eventually, their data network reaches back to their creators who collect this massive treasure trove of data."
