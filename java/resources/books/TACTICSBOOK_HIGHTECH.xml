			systems, data blocks, and information pathways instead of buildings, people, and highways.
			* Nodes - Nodes in Cyberspace are locations in Cyberspace.  Nodes include Telecom lines, Satellite Uplinks,
			Firewalls, Security Cameras, Remote Controls, Databases, and Virtual Realities.  Different Nodes usually require
			valid security or payment to use.  Nodes can also hold nasty surprises including alarms and defense programs.
			* Movement - Distances are insignificant in Cyberspace.  Instead, movement is measured in tasks.  Any program can
			perform a number of tasks each turn equal to [Netrunning] skill.  Each node entered in Cyberspace is a task.
			Performing any [Action] at a node is also a task.

				* Autonomous car used for most transit. Ordinary citizens rarely own their own

				and can travel at high speeds in tight traffic without incident.
				* History - Automated cars took over major cities within years of their invention.
				They solved traffic, parking, accident, and environmental problems all at once
				while offering cheaper per mile travel than owning your own vehicle. They rapidly
				made taxi and ridesharing solutions obsolete, and it soon became illegal for a
				human to drive a vehicle because autocars were so much safer. Soon all mass
				transit systems reduced down to autocars and some autobikes.

<chapter name="High Tech Spacecraft">
	<summary>
		* Interplanetary travel is a common reality in the 23rd century.

		* Types - Spaceships are mostly cargo and ore mining ships, followed by gas tankers.

		* Prismatic Armor - Modern ships have a very thick ablative skin composed of a honeycomb of diamond nano-fibers filled with a highly refractive, radiation and impact absorbing ceramic compound. This armor has a number of beneficial qualities. It deflects energy in random directions which provides radiation resistance, stealth, and energy weapon defense. It fragments and ablates under energy weapon and kinetic impact which shatters incoming	micro-meteors and high speed weaponry and distributes the incoming energy in all directions to prevent penetration. The ablating particles also carry away excess heat in a similar way to evaporation. The resultant particles become a cloud of anti-energy aresol. Any impact strong enough to penetrate the armor will liquify the surrounding armor which quickly solidifies and helps to seal hull breaches.

		* Deflectors - Most long-range ships are equipped with a deflector array. The array is composed of a wide bank of closely spaced ionizing lasers and particle beams. The lasers ionize the particles and form a strong magnetic force down the length of the beam. Small objects headed toward the ship are ionized by the beams and then redirected away by the magnetic field. Point defense lasers are used for larger particles as well as incoming missiles.

		* Propulsion - Propulsion spaceward (outward from the Sun) is often provided by massive Stellasers that reflect and concentrate solar radiation into a 'tight' beam similar to a laser. Ships have depolyable solar sails to capture this energy for propulsion and recharging batteries. These sails can even be used to slowly tack inward. Some cargo ships use particularly large sails to slowly sail the solar wind to reduce costs. Most ships rely on powerful nuclear thrusters for sunward (toward the Sun) travel to accelerate the ship at up to 1g. When possible the ship will accelerate for half the voyage, turn around, and then decelerate for the rest of the trip.

		* Gravity - Except for short periods of weightlessness midway through the trip, the passengers feel gravity during the trip. Up is toward the nose and down is toward the engines. The internal organization of a ship is very similar to a skyscraper. For fuel and reaction mass reasons, the ship may need to travel at slower speeds (and lower gravity) or coast at zero gravity midway through the trip. For this reason, large ships are often equipped with rotating decks to simulate gravity for the crew.

		* Reentry - Spaceships are generally too heavy and not equipped to survive a landing on anything larger than a small moon. Landing on something as massive as the Earth's Moon is possible, but achieving orbit again requires a powerful Laser Lifter system like the one on Luna.

		* Travel Costs
		** Planet to orbital station skyhooks travel daily and cost 200-300 credits one-way.
		** Orbital to moon travel twice weekly and cost 600 credits one-way.
		** Interplanetary trips are like cruises. They travel weekly and cost 20,000-30,000 credits
		one-way.

		* Safety - Inner ship walls are covered with pillowy-soft panels of 'Space Gel'. This viscous fluid provides a combination of heat insulation, impact padding, radiation shielding, shrapnel absorption, and depressurization protection. Space Gel exposed to freezing temperatures will immediately harden into a very durable solid. If the hull is breached, damaged panels will leak Space Gel. Any gel that touches an area near the breach will instantly freeze, gradually plugging the leak.

	<section name="High Mobility Forces">
		<titles>Armored Frame, Exo-Suit, MEC (Multi-Environment Cavalry), Mobile Armor, Mobile Cavalry, Mobile Invantry, Mobile Suit</titles>
		<summary>
			* Mobile - The term Mobile, short for High Mobility, was coined to describe forces that emphasized manueverability and terrain use over raw speed, weaponry, or armor.
			** Mobile Infantry - Human sized battle suits capable of increasing an infantry unit's combat ability. Early versions emphasized weapons and armor, but their high cost and attrition rate moved the focus to fast hit-and-run or blitzkreig style armor.
			** Mobile Suit - The Mobile Suit is an attempt to create a larger version of Mobile Infantry suits. They remain humanoid and can benefit from infantry tactics on a large scale. The design is a swiss army knife, capable of quickly changing and scavenging weapons and is equally suited for combat and large scale repair operations. The design does have many detractors, however, who argue that the humanoid form is not optimal for ground combat where its height makes it an easy target, air combat where it is not aerodynamic, or space combat where legs have little use.
			** Mobile Cavalry - Mobile Cavalry is any High Mobility vehicle that is optimized toward its intended enviroment: Mobile Fighters in atmosphere, Mobile Tanks on land, Mobile Subs underwater, Mobile Insects in space, etc. These system are highly specialized in contrast with the general utility of Mobile Suits. Though such designs seem more optimal, there is an argument that Mobile Suit mass production and spare part availability would ultimately win out.
			** Mobile Armor - The ultimate expression of High Mobility weapons, Mobile Armor are large, heavily armed and armored versions of Mobile Cavalry. They are terrifying monstrosities with similar reputations to the King Tiger tank in World War II. Though on paper, they seem to be the ultimate weapon, in practice their high cost and manufacturing complexity severly limited their deployment and losing even one was devastatingly costly. They can turn the tide of any battle, but were overall less effective than smaller units.
			* Linear Frame - The linear frame is a special harness that mimics the actions of the mobile suit pilot and translates them into mobile suit actions. This gives the mobile suit an uncanny agility and a strangely human grace. A trained pilot can shift the suit's center of gravity to change the armor's orientation without propellent which can substantially increase endurance and survivability.
			* Piloting - A mobile suit pilot wears a special suit and is secured to a linear frame that
			help manage the incredible g-forces that the mobile suit produces. Rookie pilots have been
			knocked unconscious or even killed by their own combat maneuvers, so extensive, specialized
			training is essential. Ace pilots seem almost superhuman in their ability to take physical
			stress without blacking out.
			* Mobile Suits vs. Capital Ships - Mobile suits have a unique ability against capital ships.
			They can land anywhere on the surface of the ship (typically outside of firing arcs) and attack
			components directly. Whenever a mobile suit on a capital ship score [Critical Hits], the player
			may look at the damage deck and choose the critical instead of choosing one at random.
			* Flight Systems - Spacecraft and Exo-Suits use a ionic plasma drive which ionizes and
			accelerates gas particles out the exhaust vents at relativistic speeds. These energized
			particles create a glowing stardust effect at the exhaust ports. These drives also function in
			atmosphere but their interaction with air creates a massive heat buildup, so they can only be
			used in short bursts like jump jets. Unusually large vents with heat dispersers can be specially
			designed for atmosphere, but these are suboptimal in space.
			* Plasma Lance - The lance is a short mobile suit melee weapon. Its firing end is a hollow
			magnetic tube lined with layers of copper leaf. When held in a specially designed hand or connector,
			a direct current from the fusion reactor transforms the copper leaf into a short ionizing plasma jet
			of incompressible copper. The lance appears as an empty weapon hilt until it fires; then it flashes
			with a brief, blinding jet that violently pierces almost any material it contacts. It is very
			effective against armor, but its uses are limited so they may only be used a few times before being
			depleted. Mobile suits will often carry multiple lances, although larger variants exist.

			Land based Mobile Suits follow these principles:
			* Maintain a low profile - Weapons are so destructive that it is much more effective to not be hit. Stay low and use cover at all times. Tracked, Wheeled, Hover and 4 legged vehicles maintain the lowest profile while still being all-terrain.
			* High mobility - Slow, predictable units are sitting ducks. Also, move in 3 dimensions to maximize mobility. This makes legs and jump jets superior to tracks and wheels.
			* Projectile weapons are more effective on the ground than in space - High caliber cannons can be mounted on land vehicles.
			* Land based Mobile Suits developed from dog-like anti-personnel hunter-killer robots. As Electromagnetic Warfare began to defeat digital circuitry, it became necessary to put soldiers back into the war machines and return to larger, more reliable analog systems.

			Space based Mobile Suits follow these principles:
			* Propellent must be expended to accelerate - a modern vehicle in space is more limited by its propellent than its fuel.
			* Arms and Legs are useful - When one part of a mobile suit is moved, it produces a counter-movement in the opposite direction. This effect can be used to adjust the mobile suit's direction without expending propellant. Thus, in zero gravity the mobile suit's arms and legs are not dead weight, but a vital component of its maneuvering system.

				* The current state-of-the-art space mecha is a wedge-shaped, heavily-armored stealth craft with a turreted particle cannon.
				* Armor Module - The wedge-shaped front, bottom, and sides of the craft are a single hot-swappable module for in combat maintainance. It is primarily composed of ablative, stealth armor. The armor is sharply angled to present the smallest possible angle of penetration and detection from the front.
				* Core Module - The center of the craft is a gyroscopic sphere. The gyroscope is so powerful, it is used for attitude control instead of maneuver jets.
				* Core Drone Module - Like most mobile armors, the Piranha is deployed in large packs (schools) of drones with random human piloted command units. Without a pilot, the core module can contain spare ammo or propellent.
				* Core Pilot Module - The pilot seat is enclosed in this sphere which allows the craft to turn very quickly while rotating the pilot seat separately to minimize angular momentum and G-forces. The escape hatch can be rotated to the top or the bottom of the ship to allow easy exit or connect to ship airlocks.
				* Mission Module - The top and back of the craft contain the weapon systems, propulsion, and fuel in a single hot swappable module. This entire module can be immediately replaced to customize the craft for a mission or rapidly refuel and reload.
				* Space Interceptor Module - The standard space module includes a single heavy particle beam turret and nuclear propulsion (including fuel and reaction mass).
				* Space Bomber Module - This module is identical to the Space Interceptor Modules but replaces the turret with a fixed medium railgun and 2 heavy penetrator nuclear missiles.
				* Orbital Insertion Module - Though rarely used, this module allows the ship to reach orbit from a planet's surface using chemical rockets. The module is also capable of independent re-entry so it can be refueled and reused without the main craft.
				* Atmospheric Interceptor Module - Jet engines and anti-aircraft missiles. With this module, the ship is capable of trans-atmospheric flight. Though its wedge shape is aerodynamic, it provides no lift, so it must rely on its thrust to maneuver and to remain airborne.
				* Atmospheric Bomber Module - Jet engines and precision bombs.
				* Atmospheric Close Support Module - Jet engines and a single heavy penetrator autocannon.
				* Air Cavalry Module - Dual turbine rotor systems and fuel with 2 light rail cannons for rescue and light air support.
				* Land Module - A turret pairing a heavy rail cannon with a high capacity rail machine gun. The rear houses a missile pod housing 6 indirect fire missiles for light bombardment.
				* Marine Module - Marine caterpillar thrust system that allows high speed surface movement or moderate underwater movement with decent stealth.
				* Command Module - Advanced communications and coordiation systems.
				* Sensor Module - Specialized long-range active and passive sensor systems for patroling or spying.
				* Stealth Module - Enhanced stealth system foregoing firepower and performance for stealth. Contains a single medium rail cannon.
				* Science Module - Highly sensitive sensor package for detailed analysis.
				* Service Module - The ship has useful carrying capacity, so besides its combat role, it operates as a repair worker bee and cargo hauler. Typically, repair crews get more flight time on the ship than combat pilots.
				* Cargo Module - A large cargo container and thruster can be afixed to the rear for transport duties.
				* Long Range Module - A variant of the cargo container can be attached to the back of another module to increase the range of the ship providing extra thrust and reaction mass. The module is jettisoned once it reaches its target and is hopefully recovered later.
				* Arms - 6 thin, light-weight arms fold out from under the ship to the front, back, and sides. Each arm has 3 powerful fingers with magnetic clamps and sharp tips that allow the craft to cling to surfaces and walk along them at high speeds like an insect. The arms are strong enough to climb vertical surfaces or be inverted under gravity. The end of each arm has an attitude control jet to aid in high speed manuevers. On land, these jets are replaced with powerful turbines that lets the craft skate across level ground or water. The elbow of each arm is a sphere that can be used as landing gear or wheels on roads or other reasonably flat terrain. 6 arms were chosen, so the craft can still move on 4 arms while carrying or dragging a heavy load with 2. As with insects, 6 arms provides sufficient redundancy in case 1 or even 2 legs are lost to damage. In land combat, the arms allow the craft to maximize cover and peek its gun around corners or over obstacles.

		<unit name="Panther Mobile Cavalry">
			<summary>
				* The current state-of-the-art land mecha is a 4 legged style reminiscent of big cats or wolves.
				* Like most mobile armors, the Panther operates in packs of drones with random human piloted command units. The pilot climbs into the back of the unit and rides in the position of a performance motorcycle.  If desired, the pilot can open the back and sit up as if riding a horse. Piloted units sacrifice a hardpoint to fit the pilot.
				* Payloads such as large caliber cannons and shields are mounted on one of two fixed back mounts. This unit can also stand on 2 legs and slide the cannon up to become a shoulder mount. All 4 legs possess manipulative hands with claws and magnets for climbing and can carry the cannon or a shield as needed. Small wheels in the elbows are used when travelling on roads.

		<summary>
			* The L5 Colonies are enormous space colonies that have been constructed at the five Lagrange points around Earth where gravitational forces are stable. They are 25km to 40km long.
			* Construction - These stations are constructed inside cylinders of Moon rock and asteroids ferried from the Asteroid Belt. The external surface is heavily armored against meteorite impacts. Industrial complexes are mostly on outermost layer of the colonies to keep them away from habitations. Towns are built on the internal surface of the colony. The internal space is divided into zones with large reflective pressure walls that give the appearance of continuous space while limiting the risk of catastrophic failure to any particular zone. Transport tubes are underground and also serve as emergency shelters. In addition to the outer cylinder, there is also an inner cylinder that forms a pressurized, zero-g drydock through the center of the colony.
			* Personnel - Those that have travelled from Earth to the Orbital stations are many of the best and brightest that Earth has to offer. Each colony supports up to 20 million people. Living space is about 300 square km, which is not a lot of room for so many people. Three or four story buildings are the norm, but they cannot be built higher than that because of the Coriolis effect.
			* Resources - Large amounts of solar energy are continuously collected, but life is difficult in space where all materials must be imported (at high tariffs). Orbital industry is generally thriving.
			* Politics - Because the Orbitals are largely corporate run and lack a specific history, they are largely free of geopolitical politics, as well as cultural and racial conflicts. They do, however, retain fierce, corporate politics. Most of all, the Orbitals chafe under the Earth bound regulatory and military agencies that supervise and tax them. Taxes are necessarily high to support so much technology, and taxes are always a point of conflict.

			* Small individual colonies are beginning to dot open space between the planets. These colonies maintain their own solar orbits and can be convenient stop over points between planets.
			* Culture - Nomad colonists are a hard working, individualistic people. Some are religious or cultural fanatics. Others are essentially criminal organizations or pirates. Nomad colonists are highly desired as crew for interplanetary commercial space flights. They are used to cramped space conditions and they are also 	talented mechanics and jury-riggers.
			* Trade - Each Nomad Colony is primarily a trading station. They do not produce anything except food for themselves. Everything else is purchased from other planets.
			* Politics - Nomad Colonies are each formed for their own reasons and maintain unique governments and social structures. They attempt to remain neutral from other nations and will trade with anyone without regard to political or criminal status. Though the Nomad colonies are each completely unique, they all recognize the other Nomads as allies and treat any threat to one as a threat to all.
			* Military - Nomad Colonies typically maintain little or no defenses as befits their neutral status. They may, however, maintain hidden defenses or pirate ships nearby.

			* Colonial Mars is much like the American Frontier. Colonists left the overcrowded and impoverished Earth in search of a new life knowing that there was almost no chance to return to the Old World. They and their children would live or die on Mars, and they proudly adopted the name Martian.
			* Terraforming - Mars is one of the greatest technological projects ever attempted by humanity.
			* Climate - Mars is in the later stages of Terraforming. The air is thin and cold but breathable, similar to a mountain top.
			* Cities - Since the atmosphere became breathable, the population on Mars has sharply increased. Cities that were once domed habitats have grown into large settlements. Land is practically free, so buildings are low and sprawling.
			* Production - Mining is the primary reason for founding the Martian colony and continues to be the main source of jobs. Terraforming, industrial equipment, and algae farming support the mining effort.
			* Politics - The Martian Council is a democratic body that establishes and enforces Martian law. Unfortunately, they are largely a puppet of the Earth Authority and have been increasingly squeezing the Martian colonists to increase production for their war efforts. This pressure has spurred the creation of the Free Mars Movement that seeks to free Mars form Earth control.

			same beds on off-shifts. Common areas are used for everything except sleeping.
			The Jovians have adapted to be far more social and reliant on others for day

			with a strong sense of group identity.
			* Science - Jovian science is one of the most advanced in the solar system.
			Research and development on ways to make their harsh life safer and more

			* Military - The military has reaped the rewards of Jovian science and is

			near the largest. Jovian forces are composed of separate standing armies:
			Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Divisions with Alpha containing the Godsfire flagship.
			Jovian military theory is based on efficient use of a small number of highly
			mobile units. They do not fear a large scale assault, since they would receive
			much forewarning of any attempt to mobilize a large force all the way out to

		* The year is 2151.

		Things are pretty bad on planet Earth:
		* Global Warming - The build up of smothering greenhouse effect gases has resulted in the complete melting of the Arctic
		ice cap as well as much of the Antartic ice cap.  Coastal areas have been inundated and global temperatures continue to
		rise, a new record every year.
		* Resource Depletion - As the climate changed, desperate farmers overfarmed their land, increasing erosion and therefore
		food prices.  Fossil fuels became increasingly scarce and given the ongoing climate problems, ecologically unsuitable.
		* Overpopulation -
		* Economic Collapse -

		Things are slightly better in space:
		* Orbital Stations - For the last hundred years, large space colonies have been constructed at the five Lagrange points
		around Earth.  Relative to Earth, the Orbital stations are gleaming paradises of corporate efficiency.  Corporate
		interests are certainly strong on the Orbital colonies, and the Orbitals increasingly chafe at Earth's taxation of their
		goods and the high tariffs on imports.
		* Luna - Huge moon bases dot the lunar surface.  With its low gravity and limitless lunar rock, the Moon is the natural
		construction center for most Orbital facilities and spaceships.  Surface and underground mining operations go around the
		clock.  Enormous massdrivers propel the material into Earth orbit.
		* Mercury - Solar stations on Mercury provide limitless power while the molten
		surface provides limitless ore. Though the surface is hellish and survival is
		difficult, Mercury provides wealth beyond imagining to those able to survive.
		The population is 90% male with most residents on a 6 year work contract. After
		the contract they usually return to wherever they came from with enough money to
		buy a house and start a family. Like a military veteran, Mercury companies also
		offer generous benefits for the rest of the contractor's life or generous death
		benefits to their family if they don't survive. Despite extensive safety systems,
		the fatatlity rate remains 1 in 20 even among these hardy folk. Politically,
		Mercury is extremely independent and has little patience for the affairs of the
		other planets.

				* Mission - Discover the Slumbering Eidolon and capture or destroy it. They could
				discover it by finding a supply or courier ship headed there during a patrol, or stumble
				across a supporting organization on a Jovian colony. The assault force would
				most probably consist of two Thunderbolts, one Javelin, and a small number of
				Pathfinders and Retaliators. If they choose to capture the Eidolon, a hurried scramble
				as a self-destruct timer counts down and bulkheads slam shut is just as exciting as an
				action-packed firefight in the command center. Agents and reporters are harder to
				integrate with the destruction of the station, but are more
				easily involved in the discovery process.

				* Summary - After the discovery and decomissioning of the secret Venusian research
				station, the Jovian government found some advanced mech prototypes that the Venusians
				had been testing in the Jovian atmosphere. This led to the Agora paying more attention
				to a request of assylum from one Dr. Peyarje, and sent the PCs to help retrieve him.

				* Dr. Peyarje - UEA has conscripted the brilliant Dr. Peyarje into their service,
				forcing him to develop next generation exo-weapons at a hidden base. In the interests of
				keeping an appearance of openness, they have allowed Peyarje to attend the 2210
				 Intersettlement Scientific Convention (ISC), though he is accompanied by a detachment
				of the UEA military. He has managed to get a plea for help and request for asylum to the
				Jovian embassy. His crowning achievement is a telepathic mech control system based on
				discoveries found from the Floaters over Jupiter.

				* Georgia On My Mind - The players have been dispatched to extract Peyarje from the ISC
				conference in Venus orbit. They are hidden among the large Jovian delegation to the ISC
				aboard the Georgia On My Mind space liner. However, in order to smuggle them aboard,
				they can carry now weapons or equipment and will need an alternate means of escape.

				* Stanton Station - A space station in Venus Orbit where the Internation Scientific
				Convention (ISC) is being held. Here, Peyarje will be allowed to present a carefully
				censored summary of his work on cyberlinkage technologies. The players should take part
				in the early stages of the ISC while they investigate the conference and find a way to
				get Peyarje away from his UEA handlers and off-station.

				* Jovians - The Jovians wish to reap the PR benefits to be found in rescuing a brilliant,
				pacifist scientist from UEA’s militaristic clutches and also hope that Peyarje can shed
				some light on some samples of his CAT/Rapid-Scan system found on a secret research
				station.

				* UEA - Unfortunately for these operatives, the UEA is taking the security of their
				prisoner very seriously. The third division of the UEA 4th fleet are moored just off
				Stanton, at the invitation of the Venusian Plantary Council, and permission has been
				granted for several officers and marines to accompany Peyarje as a security detail.
				Though the ISC filed a formal protest over the admittance of UEA military officers
				acting in an official capacity, the issue has since been dismissed and other nations
				have been allowed to included similarly-limited security details for their detachments.

				* Beautiful Dreamer - The PC's meet their contact, Ysa Cantroini and through her, Aglaee
				Dessources. Both seem to be independents commissioned by the Jovians. Ysa is surpisingly
				competent at many abilities and Aglaee has a ship for escape along with the  characters'
				gear and mechs.


* CHARACTER INVOLVEMENT
JAF pilots could be members of an official JAF escort, added (as mentioned
above) to balance out the UEA military forces escorting Dr. Peyarje. The pilots would still be
instructed to ask questions and discretely investigate, but would be intended to act as a decoy
and backup for the real extraction team. By asking questions and poking their noses into places
they don’t belong, they would be expected to draw attention away from the real JIS operatives.
Who could, in turn, be exposed and captured at the last minute, forcing the players to pull off
the heist on their own with insufficient planning.

The players could be the backup JIS team instead of the primary, tasked with investigating and
doing footwork for the primary team. This puts them on the front lines, while the primary team
works to solidify their own cover. The primary team’s cover could then be blown, forcing the
players to execute the operation, and keeping them on the front lines. This has many hooks for
complications and intruigue. What if the compromised team wasn’t discovered, but betrayed
by a double agent in their own ranks? This goes well with the scenario (see below) that has
the players trapped in hiding on Stanton. What if the Venusians (specifically, Malachai) were
aware of the operation all along and either want the operatives to expose themselves or for the
operation to succeed/fail for reasons of their own?

Reporters have the easiest time finding cover identities - they don’t need them. The ISC is a big
deal, and reporters from all over the solar system can be expected to attend. And reporters are
expected to be nosy, so no-one’s going to take excessive notice of a few asking questions where
they shouldn’t. However, due to their typical lack of combat skills, reporters will probably be harder
to handle for the actual freeing of Peyarje. They would probably have to resort to subterfuge and
trickery if called upon to get Peyarje away from his guards themselves. One possibility is to have
JIS agents already in place on Stanton handle the snatch, then pass Peyarje off to the reporters
for transport, as in the JAF pilots write-up above.

The 3rd Division of the CEGA 4th fleet is composed of:
 • 2 Tengu carriers with extra vehicle bays.
 • 4 Bricru corvettes.
 • 1 Hachiman destroyer.

One Tengu carries a Wyvern and three Wraiths, while the other carries four Syreens. The
squadron is accompanied by several fuel ships, to give extra range to the short-legged CEGA
warships. Garand’s Wyvern is the Command variant. While the Hachiman is technically the
flagship of the squadron, Garand usually commands from aboard his Tengu where he has easy
access to his exo-armor. This can be used to involve Kleb in the scenario without Garand’s
knowledge - Kleb could be travelling aboard the Hachiman, watching and ready to take command
should the situation demand it.

				* Escape - The 3rd Divison lacks is deployed far from reinforcements, so it will act
				cautiously. They know that they don’t need to kill the players - they need to capture
				the Dreamer. The PCs should realize this, and be careful not to let themselves be drawn
				away... For what seems like a retreat could really be an attempt to lure them away so
				that another force can slip in and disable the Dreamer’s engines.

				* Beautiful Dreamer - Rescued from his UEA handlers at the Intersettlement Scientific
				Convention, Dr. Peyarje and his rescuers have fled Venus aboard the Beautiful Dreamer,
				privateer ship commanded by Aglaee DesSources. Unfortunately, they have not lost the UEA
				forces seeking to recapture Peyarje. The 3rd Division of the UEA 4th fleet, commanded
				by ace pilot Ranho Garand, is in hot pursuit.

				* Intercept Course - DesSources’ skillful helmsmanship makes the most of their limited
				reaction mass, but Garand’s 3rd Division is slowly closing in, blocking the orbits they
				could use to travel out-system. Garand's fleet makes a high energy burn and manages to
				intercept them and another heated battle ensues. After the battle, the UEA force, having
				used their remaining reaction mass to intercept must wait for a fuel tender to continue
				the pursuit.

				* The Long Trip to Earth - Low on fuel, with the UEA pursuit fleet closing in fast, the
				crew of the Beautiful Dreamer find themselves with only one option: change course and
				head for the Earth system, the heart of the UEA and the only source of supplies and fuel
				in range. Perhaps they can loose their pursuers in the high-traffic Orbitals and find
				another way to Jupiter. Because reaction mass is low and they need to run silent, the
				trip takes many days at zero-g. Many days in radio silence are spent discussing ways to
				get out of this mess.

				* Ismael Li - Fortunately, the Jovians have been working hard to save the mission and
				have made a deal with a burgeoning rebel group on the Moon which can to provide them
				with the fuel and parts they need... For a price!

				* The Eagle has Landed - Now they just need to avoid the blockade and land on the Moon.
				Though the Moon has very low gravity, the Beautiful Dreamer is not designed to land on
				a Moon. Even if they survive the landing, they may not be able to take off again.
				However, there is no choice in the matter. After a harrowing landing, the rebels help
				bury the Dreamer in lunar dust and begin repairs and refueling.

				* Copernicus Base - The characters are invited to the underground, domed city known as
				Coperinus Base. Here the charismatic Ismael Li introduces them to the harsh life of
				the Lunar miners. There is nothing to do but wait and meet the pleasant locals while the
				ship is repaired and the UEA prepares its next move.

				* The Plot Thickens - Gradually, Ismael brings the characters to see supporters and see
				his gear. Ismael intends to lead a rebellion to take over Copernicus Base and he needs
				the characters' help. His group lacks seasoned fighters and they lack tactics,
				organization, and strategy. This revelation sparks a heated debate over the wisdom of
				this endevour. No one can argue that their situation is difficult, but even if they
				succeed the Lunar Authority and the UEA will not just sit back and allow a rebellion.
				Ismael argues that once they seize control, the Lunar Authority will have to negotiate.
				Others fear a strong, military response. Any armed conflict in a space station is
				loaded with risk. If one of the characters befriends or falls in love with one of the
				rebels, it would add a more personal edge to the rebellion.

				* Eleventh Hour - With or without the characters' help, Ismael begins to grease the
				wheels of revolution through raids, assassinations, sabotage, and public relations
				campaigns. Their target is Captain Ansevik the head of Copernicus security. If they
				can capture her, they believe they can secure the base.

				* Moon Strike - After providing the characters with the repairs and fuel they need, he
				launches his armed uprising in the depths of Copernicus hoping to drag them into the
				fight. Moving barricades outwards at carefully-regulated intervals, his troops and
				exo-suits advance through the dome, driving out the UEA bureaucrats and policemen as
				they go. The few initial firefights go well for the rebels.

				* The Tide Turns - About six hours into the fighting, things begin to turn. Ansevik
				manages to get her exo-suit forces into Copernicus, and their numbers mean bad things
				for the rebels.

				* Evacuation - Catherine Glit starts an evacuation of refugees. The rebels lift as many
				to hastily-contracted merchant and passenger ships in lunar orbit as they can. Things
				become even more chaotic as the Selenties abandon their posts and the rebels fall back
				before the UEA forces. Organizing such a retreat is no easy task. Dessources takes as
				many refugees as possible aboard the Dreamer. Ysa wants to help the rebels fight. The
				characters should be involved in the fighting or evacuation effort somehow. After all,
				it was their presence that provided the catalyst that started the rebellion.

				* Escape - Her holds crammed with refugees and UAE ships starting to move in, Aglaee
				orders the characters back to the ship. Greatful for their help, Li lets them go. He
				sends Catherine Glit with them at the last minute, against her wishes. As the characters
				head for the spaceport, the rebels begin another counter-attack, slowly forcing the UAE
				ground troops back and taking the spaceport and ground-to-orbit weapons. The citizens
				who couldn’t be evacuated riot, pelting helpless UEA infantry and marines with rocks and
				bricks. Things are obviously not going well for the UEA troops.

				* Copernicus Dome Disaster - Ansevik realizes that the rebels could use the city's
				ground-to-orbit weapons to attack his warships. He must now choose whether to withdraw
				or fire on the defensive batteries. In a panic, Ansevik orders his ships to attack the
				laser and missile batteries. The resulting explosions are far larger than expected and
				shatter the dome. A hasty retreat ensues as the Dome opens to vacuum, killing rebel,
				civilian, and UEA marine alike.

				* Chaos -  Ismael Li operates the Laser Lifter to boost the refugee ships away, including
				the Dreamer. Li's last words, relayed to his friends and helpers aboard the Dreamer, are
				My life for freedom! The Dreamer attempts to escape with the other refugee ships, but
				the UEA ships are positioned to easily stop them. The UEA demands their surrender, but
				the UEA ships are then ordered to focus on rescue instead of pursuing the refugee ships.

				* Aftermath - In the end, thousands are killed in Copernicus Dome. The UEA, of course,
				refuses to take the blame for the Dome disaster. Their first desperate response is to
				put the blame on the Jovian terrorists who abducted Peyarje. Reporters use Ansevik’s
				actions as fodder for their own counter-attack against UEA’s propaganda.

				* Notes - Develop the rebellion and the rebels, especially Ismael Li. Emphasize the
				moon’s restrained and industrious culture and the rampant poverty and utilitarian
				nature of the underground cities. If appropriate, show the corruption of the UEA
				officials that oversee the colonies. Play up the initial hope and final despair of the
				rebels, the desperation of the refugees to find a better life, and the chaos of
				close-quarters fighting in the Lunar warrens.

				* Mission to Mars - The UEA is in pursuit again and logically expects the Dreamer to
				head to Jupiter. However, with its high speed escape and her holds crammed with refugees,
				there’s no way for the Beautiful Dreamer to make Jupiter without running out of supplies
				or fuel. Fortunately for her crew and desperate passengers, the ship can easily make
				Mars. There, Aglaee DesSources hopes that the Martian Republic will be able to provide
				homes to the refugees.

				* Decoy - The UEA pursuit will soon catch up and they cannot be allowed to follow the
				Dreamer to Mars, so a desperate plan is devised. The booster rockets from the Moon are
				removed and fitted with decoy gear to make the rockets appear as the Dreamer. The pilots
				will escort the rockets on the current course while the Dreamer makes a course
				correction and silently coasts towards Mars. The escort will engage enemy mechs drawing
				out the enemies resources while maintaining the charade as long as possible. Once the
				decoy is discovered the pilots must return to the rockets and activate the massive
				rockets to boost away at high speed to rendevous with the Dreamer. This plan is loaded
				with risk and the pilots will probably be caught or killed. Their farewell is long and
				emotional. After the Moon, the pursuit fleet commander has been ordered to kill everyone
				aboard the Dreamer both in revenge and to eliminate witnesses. When the UEA pursuit
				fleet catches up to the decoy, a heated fight begins with no quarter given. Because the
				UEA is out for blood, they focus on the pilots instead of the 'Dreamer'. The pilots are
				driven back and the ruse is discovered. The pilots must make a desperate dash to the
				booster and escape before they are blown out of the sky. Fortunately, they escape though
				with heavy losses and damage and rendevous with the Dreamer on schedule. The UEA fleet
				has overcommitted to Jupiter and are unable to pursue to Mars. Anxious days pass as the
				Dreamer travels at full speed to Mars. When they arrive they will have to hope that the
				Martian government doesn't arrest them on the spot. Meanwhile, Garand has deduced that
				the refugees will divert the Dreamer to Mars (because that's what he would do), but his
				disgust with his superiors' handling of the battle on the Moon causes him to go to Mars
				on his own.

				* Mars Arrival - The Dreamer enters Mars orbit and is immediately escorted by a fighter
				wing and two destroyers. The escort demands that the Dreamer stand down all weapons and
				prepare to be boarded. They have little choice in the matter. There is nowhere else to
				go. The boarding party secures the engine room and bridge and dock the Dreamer at the
				massive Orbital Elevator space station called Heaven. All passengers are taken to
				immigration while their ship is searched. Here they meet Yanna Summers, the chief
				adminstrator of the Elevator. Little information is forthcoming and all senior staff are
				to be taken by shuttle to Mars Federation police headquarters. As they descend, they get
				an amazing view of the incredible Orbital Elevator in action.

				* Stairway to Heaven - Constructed with the aid of Venus Bank, the Martian Orbital
				Elevator, Stairway to Heaven is a marvel of engineering. It stretches upwards from its
				base at Hell Station just north of the Federation capital of Kurtzenheim to the Heaven
				Station counterweight. The elevator is dominates the landscape and has become a symbol
				of Mars Federation authority. It shines like a moon day or night, and it catches the
				first light of day every sunrise before the rest of Mars. Its ore containers crawl up
				and down the tether 24 hours a day. The current chief adminstrator, Yanna Summers, is
				extremely organized and professional and keeps very tight ship.

				* Martian Politics - Since its creation, the Orbital Elevator has become the center of
				Martian politics. Mars has two major political factions: the Mars Federation and the
				Free Republic of Mars. The Mars Federation is an authoritarian regime. It controls most
				of Mars and is loosely allied with the UEA. The Free Republic of Mars is smaller and is
				largely at odds with everything the Federation does. The Orbital Elevator has become the
				center of Martian debate because the Federation controls the Elevator and the huge
				profits it produces will allow the Federation to dominate the Free Republic in just a
				few years. Open conflict on Mars has become common and numerous terrorist organizations
				perform increasingly savage raids on the Mars Federation. The Federation in turn blames
				the Republic of backing the terrorists which is not entirely without merit.

				* Life on Mars - At police headquarters, they must negotiate for asylum for the
				refugees and avoid arrest and extridition to the UEA. They meet with Paul Treben of the
				Solar Police who is surprised to learn of the unofficial version of the events on the
				Moon. He will report everything he learns to his superiors who will in turn secretly
				inform the UEA. Representatives from both political factions arrive intending to use the
				characters to their own ends. The Mars Federation wants to extridite the characters as
				terrorists, but the Free Republic grants the refugees asylum and puts a hold on the
				extridition of the crew of the Dreamer.

				* Waiting Around - Support for the UEA is weak here, so the characters are released for
				the time being, though they are escorted by an armed detail at all times. Garand and his
				elite unit are also poking around and soon confronts the high profile characters, but he
				has no authority on Mars and can do nothing while the characters remain. In the meantime,
				the refugees are brought to the Free Republic and a media circus begins as their stories
				hit the airwaves. The public is shocked and sympathetic to the Selenites, but this soon
				turns to rage as it becomes clear that the same thing could happen to them. The normal
				protests for fair use of the Orbital Elevator break out into massive riots and terrorist
				activity spikes across Mars.

				* Dangerous Liason - Though the govenments seems to treat the characters like criminals,
				the public treats them like celebrities or even heroes. While out and about, a pretty
				young woman approaches one of the males and gushes about how wonderful he is and leaves
				him her contact code on a slip of paper. After further inspection, the contact code is
				not a personal address but a secure web site. Following the link, they speak with the
				girl, Lydia Ketchum, but her manner is very different. She is a political radical who
				has been implicated in terrorist activity including attacks on police and bombings. She
				is proud of her actions and believes that giving her life for a free Mars would be a
				fair trade. She proposes a daring escape plan. Her people will help smuggle the
				characters up the elevator in a depressurize ore car. There they must fight their way
				through the station, take over the administration headquarters, and release their ship
				and mechs from impound. Her people can then use the station defenses to cover their
				escape. With the station under her control, she can negotiate fair use of the elevator
				going forward from a position of strength.

				* Departure - Lydia's plan does not sound entirely rational, and she is not the sort of
				person who can be trusted. However, without allies the characters are never going to
				escape Mars, so they have no choice but to take a chance regardless of the consequences.
				Catherine and Ibrahim are unsure of their long-term safety on Mars and decide to join
				the group to continue all the way to Jupiter despite the risks.

				* Hell Ride - After days of planning, Lydia's people distract the guards and the
				characters make a run for it. After they make their escape, they are swiftly taken to
				an ore processing plant and smuggled aboard an ore train car. In the train are guns,
				pressure suits, Lydia, and four of her people. The train goes to Hell station where the
				cars are searched. Tense moments pass as they wait for the inspector to get to their
				car. When he opens the car, he looks right at them, winks at Lydia, waves his scanner,
				and lets the car pass. The characters must take care not to be crushed when the train
				contents are dumped into an elevator crawler. Soon, the crawler begins its long, slow
				trip up the elevator.

				* Heaven Sent - When the elevator arrives at Heaven, its contents are dumped into an
				open bin. More of Lydia's sympathizers help them bypass security forces. Now the
				characters need to get to Heaven's Command Center with as little bloodshed as possible.
				Complicating the situation, Garand appears on a screen. He and his men have commendeered
				an elevator crawler and are on their way up with their mechs. Though Heaven is a huge
				structure, it is not a military installation, so with the help of sympathizers, getting
				to the Command Center is surprisingly easy. Yanna is enraged, but her actions are always
				pragmatic, so she surrenders the Command Center when the odds are stacked against her.

				* Elevator Falls - Once Command is secured, the way to the Dreamer is open. Lydia says
				she will cover their escape and then begin negotiations with the govenment for release
				of the station. She is, of course, lying. After the Dreamer departs, she does help the
				Dreamer escape by threatening the UEA ships who cannot fire on the station, but once the
				Dreamer is clear, she turns Heaven's weapons on the tether. As the support is destroyed,
				Heaven begins spinning out of orbit while the elevator cable begins to fall, slowly at
				first, then faster and faster. Garand uses his mech to punch free of the doomed elevator,
				but he is a very low orbit. The damage from the cable's impact is incredible, as the
				white-hot dimond-fiber cable slams into the red dust at several times the speed of sound.
				The elevator is more than one and a half the length of the planet's equator and slowly
				wraps itself around Mars destroying everything around it for miles. The impact raises a
				massive cloud of dust and leaves a huge canyon visible from space. The destruction is
				unequalled in the history of mankind. The death toll is in the millions. The UEA must
				rescue Garand and Heaven station, so the Dreamer crew can begin the sad trip to Jupiter.

			<summary>
				* Epilogue - The Heaven crew is rescued from a harrowing tumble into space, but the
				station spins off into space. Lydia proudly takes full credit for the assault in the
				name of a free Mars. There is little doubt that Lydia will be tried and executed which
				seemed to be her plan from the start. Her testimony makes it seem that she duped the
				Dreamer crew into fighting her battle for her. There are many, however, who draw a
				connection between the Dreamer crew and the disasters on the Moon and Mars. They are
				not officially terrorists, but you wouldn't know it from some of the news stations. The
				elevator disaster almost exclusively harmed the Mars Federation which shifted the
				balance of power back toward the Free Republic, which was Lydia's intention. Garand was
				saved by a daring low-orbit rescue. The UEA uses his story and the elevator fall to try
				to deflect attention from their crimes on the Moon, but the UN determines that the
				Copernicus Disaster was an act of state oppression and that the UEA should be subjected
				to sactions.

				* Jupiter - With fresh supplies and full fuel tanks, the Dreamer is easily able to make
				Jupiter. There, Dr. Peyarje transfers to the JAW Skunk Works team on Joshua Station.
				His new thought control system is refitted into the new Prometheus prototype mech.

				* A Mad Plan - The UEA leadership assesses their situation are are not happy at all.
				They invested massive resources developing Dr. Peyarje's mech control system to gain the
				upper hand, but now that technology will shift military power toward the Jovians instead.
				Their actions have caused the Selenites to openly hate and fear them. The Martian
				economy is in ruins with their ally the Mars Federation hit hardest. The Venusian Bank
				is still behind them, but they won't be if UEA influence collapses. The military proposes
				a heartless plan: destroy the Jovian colonies now before the new technology can be used
				and the entire Solar System will fall under UEA control. The Venusians can be bought off.
				The disasters on the Moon and Mars leave them in no position to fight back. The other
				colonies are too small and will have to fall in line. All of this chaos has created an
				opportunity to establish a new order, but the time to act is now.

				* The Hammer Falls - The 4th Fleet, still assigned to recover Peyarje and waiting just
				outside of Jovian space, is ordered into action. The Elysee Station sensor net has been
				disabled by a UEA agent, allowing the fleet to close with the colony undetected. A
				powerful jamming device has been deployed by the fleet to prevent the station from
				calling for help. The ships and mechs are ordered to attack Joshua Station to disable
				their defenses and force them to negotiate the extradition of the 'terrorists'.
				Unknown to them, their attack is a diversion for an elite squad of marines in exo-suits
				who will use retro-rocket packs to deorbit Elysee Station. Their real plan is to send
				the capital colony and all its inhabitants plunging into the Jovian atmosphere within
				twenty-four hours. With its leaders and their central hub gone, the Jovians will fall
				under UEA control.

				* Dragonstriker - On Joshua station, the characters are introduced to the new elite
				Vindicator mechs as well as the prototype Prometheus. Each have been fitted with the new
				CAT control system, but have yet to be tested. Suddenly advanced warning alarms sound,
				the station is under attack! Ranho Garand's team of elite mechs are charging toward the
				station, his massive Dragonstriker armor slicing through the Jovian defenses. His
				intense will and discipline give him near-perfect control over the still imperfect
				control system fitted to the prototype Dragonstriker. The characters launch to meet him,
				and the Dreamer hastily launches to lend support to the defending destroyers. All long
				range communications are disrupted by jammers, so a courier ship is sent to warn the
				other colonies. The battle is intense, but before it can be resolved, the courier
				returns. The pilot, Carl DeMers, broadcasts a warning when the interference clears:
				there is another larger force that has attacked Elysee station! They have fixed rocket
				packs to the hull and are decelerating the entire colony out of orbit! Everyone at
				Elysee will die when the station breaks up in Jupiter's atmosphere.

				* Taking Sides - Kleb’s total lack of honor have pushed Garand’s loyalties to the
				breaking point. If he finds out about the true plan for Elysee, he will turn on Kleb’s
				fleet. This will cause other fleet elements loyal to Garand to turn or withdraw from
				combat. The mechs board their ships are are quickly, re-outfitted on the short trip to
				Elysee.

				* The God and the Dragon - They arrive at Elysee to find the battle in full swing, with
				the Jovian forces slowly being driven back by the UEA Fleet, and the retro-rockets are
				just beginning to fire. The JSS Godsfire, its weapon block mauled by enemy fire, is
				trying to evacuate as many civillians as it can, using its remaining firepower to keep
				the UEA exos and fighters at a distance. Two teams are deployed: one to fight the UEA
				special forces and disable the rockets, and the another to battle the UEA fleet. The
				arrival of the Prometheus and Dragonstriker, and a detachment of other exo-armors,
				quickly turns the tide of battle. The battle seems unlikely to be resolved soon, thanks
				to the power of Kleb’s Posideon flagship. Garand confronts his former boss, and flies
				straight toward the Posideon. The Dragonstriker is heavily damaged by the fire, but
				manages to clamp unto the Posideon's bridge and opens fire at point blank range. The
				Dragonstriker and Posideon go up in a massive explosion, damaging nearby ships. The tide
				of battle suddenly turns. Many UEA soldiers were unhappy with Admiral Kleb's actions and
				are easy to convince with impassioned plees. The rockets are disabled and Elysee station
				uses its engines to regain its correct orbit.

				* Epilogue: Garand - Of Garand, no remains are found. While he could have escaped in the
				escape pod, it seems unlikely that he survived. That the CSS Karana, an Uller-class
				missile cruiser believed destroyed during the battle, is missing is noticed during
				cleanup months later, but no connection is ever made between the two events. Garand did
				survive, but was horribly wounded, and was recovered later by the crew of the Karana,
				who had trained under him.

				* Epilogue: UEA - Kleb was killed in the destruction of the Scylla’s bridge. The UEA
				government publically him off as a 'lone gunman' who acted without official sanction and
				engages in a ruthless purge of the Navy’s command structure to 'remove any who might
				seek to follow Admiral Kleb’s example'. In fact, they use this to eliminate to expunge
				or marginalize those taught by Garand or 'corrupted' by his philosophy from the upper
				ranks. Their shadowy ties to Venus remain as strong as ever, and, much to their relief,
				the diplomatic repercussions of the Odyssey affair fade away over the next year.

				* Epilogue: Venus - Malachai falls into disgrace with VenusBank for his failure to
				produce results or protect the existance of Project Methuselah, and becomes a
				dissatisfied freelancer. For the next decade he wanders the solar system, hatching mad
				schemes to put him in the good graces of his former employer once more and destroy the
				Confederation. He is eventually captured by SolaPol and disappears. VenusBank begins
				scaling back its operations slightly, uncertain of just how much the Confederation knows.
				No public or private charges are ever made by the Confederation over the poaching of the
				Floaters or the aims of Project Methuselah, leaving the Bank executives in a very
				unpleasant information vacuum.

				* Epilogue: Mars - The consequences of the Martian Elevator take a long time to
				show themselves. Initially, neither Martian government accuses the other of the
				collapse. Evidence is sketchy, and the presence of Jovian and UEA agents on-site makes
				things even more uneasy.

		<scenario name="A Damaged Freighter">
			<summary>
				* The UEA Black Eagle Squadron is smuggled aboard the freighter Narsus to recover the
				datacore of the Lucifer and destroy any evidence. The Black Eagles had planned to slip
				onto Europa undetected after the Narsus dropped into orbit around the moon. Supposedly,
				she was to be taking on water for a journey up to Ganymede. The plan was that she
				would deploy the Eagles’ exo-armors, head off to deliver the rest of her cargo, then
				return and pick them up a week later. Faulty parts led to an explosion in Narsus'
				engines during her insertion burn. The captain managed to drop the freighter into a
				stable orbit around Europa before the engines completely died, but then, as is
				standard practice for merchant crews, immediately set off a distress beacon.
				* With all the unexplained attacks in Jovian space lately, an exo-armor patrol is
				dispatched from their carrier to investigate. The crew seems to sincerely have
				severe engine trouble. Some of the Jovians will have to board the Narsus leaving
				their exos tethered to the hull. The remainder stay on patrol.
				* Inside, the freighter is in zero-g and is particularly cramped. The crew's story
				seems to hold up, but the four passengers are uneasy about the situation. The engines
				are in bad shape and are irradiated. The cargo hold has large, sealed, liquid cargo
				bins labeled with warnings as liquid methane. If the Jovians start attempt to open the
				cargo, the captain will lose his nerve and reveal that the passengers are UEA pilots.
				A firefight erupts and the Black Eagles get into the cargo containers and remotely
				open the cargo bay to vacuum. The UEA troops escape by detonating the Narsus as a
				distraction (killing the crew, of course) and releasing an ECM scrambler pod. They
				have clearly descended to Europa somewhere.

				* With Europa's low surface gravity, the Black Eagle team's exo-armors descend to the

				of ice. Unlike ice on Earth, this isn’t slippery - it’s nowhere near the freezing
				point. The surface is perilous with unstable ground and spontaneous geysers.
				* The UEA team radios for a pickup using a small signal booster in orbit. They then
				begin a tedious search for the Lucifer.
				* The JAF patrol rejoins its carrier and begins a search of Europa.
				* The UEA team eventually discovers the crashed Lucifer but finds footprints and
				vehicle tracks nearby. The data core has already been removed and taken to the small
				research station Europa 1. The UEA team breaks the ice beneath the Lucifer to let it
				fall into the ocean below never to be discovered. Then they must follow the tracks to

				underground shelters. If they run out of time, the UEA may be forced to destroy the
				base, but this would not guarantee the destruction of the data core.
				* The JAF can immediately land at the base and are introduced to Dr. Han Krieger and
				his attractive daughter Paula. They have recovered the data core, but did not have
				sufficient equipment to study the downed ship.
				* If the UEA can get close enough they can hack the core remotely and trigger a data
				wipe. They may also threaten to blow up the base if they are not given the core.
				Whether they succeed or not, the UEA will have to retreat back to the rendezvous

				* As the JAF prepare to meet them, the frigate opens fire. Suddenly, there is a deep
				tremor in the ice below. The UEA agents feel it too and stop code. Suddenly, from under
				the ice, an impossibly brilliant beam of light lances up to engulf one of the
				descending exo-armors. It doesn't explode but it just melts and disappears in the beam.
				Soon, the ice seems to explode and the enormous black form of the Lucifer rises from
				below.
				* With its data core removed and a firefight nearby, it switched to its limited,
				secondary systems and it is unable to determine friend from foe. Its massive guns are
				clearly building another charge and moments later it fires at the frigate's engines.
				The crippled engines briefly leak fusing hydrogen before destroying the frigate in a
				nuclear fireball. It then begins to engage the new exo-armors from the frigate.
				* The JAF and UEA will have to quickly come to terms with the fact that the Lucifer
				will kill them all unless they work together.
				* If the Lucifer escapes, it will boosts off Europa into a tight slingshot orbit
				and then use its ECM systems to hide in Jupiters radiation belt. Without its higher
				brain functions, the Lucifer is more of a killing machine than an assassin, so it is
				now a question of how much damage it will do before it is taken down.
				* If the Lucifer is destroyed over Europa, it will crash into the ice and be lost in
				the depths. Without their pickup, the UEA agents will have to negotiate the terms of
				their surrender. Regardless, they will be tried and interrogated for their actions.

				* The Javelin is the most common warship in the Jovian Navy despite its
				age and lack of interceptor or Mech Bays. Its design is based on
				pre-Mech combat philosophy, emphasizing heavy weapons on capital ships as
				opposed to projection of force using smaller craft. Therefore, it is
				very heavily armed for a relatively small craft including the deadly
				heavy particle beam cannon.
				* Crew accomodations are small but comfortable with cleverly placed
				mirrors throughout the ship that give the illusion of greater interior
				space.

			<titles>CXS-01B, Automated Experimental Terror Raider</titles>
			<summary>
				* The Lucifer’s designed for one purpose - to ambush and kill enemy warships.  Its
				sophisticated Stealth systems allow it to hide and its strong electronic warfare suite
				prevents its prey from calling for help.  Powerful thrusters allow it to accelerate at
				incredible speeds, and a cluster of six small linked particle cannons and two large
				ones allow it to inflict massive damage very quickly.
				* Armor - Despite the advanced technology, its armor is quite thin for its size, and
				in a stand-up fight, it will almost certainly lose. The only questions are how to
				force it into a stand-up fight and how many of its attackers it can take with it.
				* Particle Cannons - The combined power of the dual particle cannons are equal to a
				spaceship's main gun. They have separate fusion engines just to recharge its capacitors,
				but it still takes 30 seconds between firings.
				* Particle Array - The 6 smaller particle cannons are designed for rapid fire against
				fast moving targets and are used between firing of the main guns.
				* Claws - Its claws are independent wire-guided drones armed with small energy weapons
				to deal with enemy interceptors. The claws are very fast and agile, but not very tough.
				They can replenish their fuel reserves by docking with the Lucifer.
				* Speed - The drones will almost never use their full top speed, and the Lucifer will
				make every effort to conserve its remass.  For long-range travel, it won’t boost at
				more than 0.4 or 0.6 Gs except in short bursts.  Much of its time will be spent
				drifting along a medium-traffic orbit.
				* Stealth - The Lucifer carries an advanced ECM/stealth package that allows it to
				sneak up on enemies and attempt to cripple them while scrambling any distress calls.

Twelve of these units were assigned to the Kojima Battalion stationed in Southeast Asia, particularly to the 04th and 08th MS Teams. Since the RX-79[G]'s were made primarily of spare parts leftover from "Project V," no replacement parts were available. This resulted in hasty field repairs

Zeon's closest answer to the Federation's Pegasus class carrier, the Zeon Zanzibar class mobile cruiser replaced the vulnerable H.L.V. for the purpose of ferrying mobile suits to Earth and back to space. With a capacity of 6 mobile suits and a battery of bow-mounted mega particle guns, the Zanzibar was often used as the command ship for smaller fleets when a Gwazine class battleship was either unavailable or unsuitable. Lacking the Pegasus class' integral Minovsky Craft System, the Zanzibar could only operate for short periods in Earth's atmosphere, using sustained thrust. When being launched back into space, the Zanzibar class required a special rocket booster to supply the necessary thrust to break free of Earth's gravity.
 like most Zeon warships of the One Year War, lacked launch catapults, instead deploying its complement of mobile suits through a simple hatch on the ventral hull.

thruster acceleration and maneuverability. To help keep its cost down, the Nemo used many weapons
already employed by other existing mobile suits, such as the RMS-099 Rick Dias' beam saber and the
GM II's beam rifle.

Performance: maximum thruster acceleration: 0.86 G (mobile suit mode), 1.99 G (mobile fortress mode)
Equipment and design features: sensors, range 16230 meters; psycho control chair in cockpit; detachable head, can be operated without main body
Fixed armaments: 20 x mega beam gun, power rated at 6.3 MW each, 3 mounted in each shoulder, 4 mounted in each leg, 2 mounted in each hip armor, 1 mounted in each front waist armor; 3 x mega scattering beam gun, power rated at 10.7 MW each, mounted in torso; 2 x wire-guided psycommu beam sword, power rated at 1.7 MW each, mounted in forearms; 10 x beam gun, emitter barrels mounted as fingers in hands; 2-barrel mega beam gun, mounted in head
Remote weapons: reflector bits, deflects and redirects beam weapons fire, stored in backpack
Though armed with the same 3-barreled scattering mega particle gun in its chest and beam gun fingers, the Psyco Gundam Mark II also mounted 20 smaller beam guns all over its body, giving it firepower capable of attacking targets in all directions. Its forearms also mounted large-bladed beam swords, and could be detached and directed at targets via a cable connection and through the control of the Psyco Gundam Mark II's psycommu system, giving the unit an all-range attack capability quite similar to that of the Principality of Zeon's MSN-02 Zeong. The Psyco Gundam Mark II also carried a set of 'reflector bits,' which were unarmed but used to redirect its own beam weapons fire to targets that are out-of-sight, or to deflect incoming enemy beam weapons fire.
