       "This book subscribes to a more nuanced version of humanoid creatures than the classic Elves and Dwarves:
* Like Great Danes and Poodles are just dogs that have rapidly changed in the face of selective breeding, these beings are still human.
* They have minor differences in abilities, but these are cultural.
* In this book, their physical and cultural differences are meant to be analogies for modern cultural differences and intolerance.
* Languages:
** Each nation has its own language. Most travellers learn many languages in addition to tradespeak.
** Tradespeak - Merchants have created this simple language to facilitate trade. It is a very limited language, but can be used for basic communication if there is no alternative. It uses a simple format with no plurals, conjegation or tense: {Adjective(s)} {Subject Noun} {Adverb(s)} {Verb} {Adjective(s)} {Object Noun}. Examples: Trustworthy me offer 10 healthy sheep. Honorable you please each pay 20 silver.
** Thieves' Cant - A variant on Tradespeak that emphasizes secret or silent communication to mask criminal activity."

          :summary
           "* Description - Uruks are a relatively primitive species of barrel-chested humanoids distantly related to Humans. They are sturdy and imposing figures, trained by hard labor and warfare since birth. They range in height from 5 feet to 7 feet tall and typically have yellowish/grey/green skin, red/black/brown eyes, and long black/grey/white hair. Their noses are flat and they have a notably large mouth with uneven teeth.
* Personality - Uruks are typically violent, impatient, and crude. They take what they want by force and are difficult to bargain with. Their culture and leaders claim that they are destined to take over the world and take back all that has been taken from them. Now they are consumed with wrath and envy of the achievements of other races and other orc tribes.
* Culture - Their civilization is still in a hunter/gatherer stage. They lack the patience and desire to read, cultivate crops, domesticate herd animals, or invent sophisticated equipment. They live a semi-nomadic existence depending on the availability of resources and the charisma of their leaders. Uruk 'kingdoms' are short lived. The race's genius for battle does not extend itself to statecraft, and their conquests inevitably collapse under a struggle for power between rival leaders. Uruk society is completely male dominated. Females are expected to find a male to support them and begin their life's purpose: breeding. Any female of breeding age that has no male protector is considered available to any male that chooses to take her and support her. Other cultures consider this to be rape. Uruks call it marriage. They extend this practice to captured females from other races.
* Warfare - Uruks wage constant war on any group near them until they take what is 'rightfully' theirs. When warbands grow large enough, they spill down into neighboring settlements to rape, murder, raid, and pillage. These bands can take on the proportions of a large town or small city, and roll across the countryside leaving burning wreckage in their wake.
* Language - Uruks speak the rough and unflattering Uruk tongue, which has no alphabet. Uruk culture and history is passed along in an oral tradition.
* Morale - Normal
* Preferred Skills - Melee, Rage
* Units - Light Infantry, Light Spearmen, Light Archers, Light Cavalry, King
* Factions - Skullsplitter, Bonegrinder"

History
* The Impergium - 8,000 years ago, humankind was becoming more organized and began systematically killing wolves or destroying their habitats. The Werewolves born from wolves decided that the humans were out of control and leading the world to chaos. They declared the open hunt (or culling) of humans called the 	Impergium. The Werewolves born from humans saw their own kin murdered by other Werewolves. Whatever the merits of the Impergium, it triggered a civil war between the Werewolf clans with mounting killings and atrocities. The other shapeshifters tried to stay out of the conflict but were quickly forced to take sides. The conflict only ended after the number of Shapeshifters across the world was decimated, especially those born to wolves. Since then the low birth rate of Shapeshifters has taken many races to the brink of extinction. The Impergium remains as a grim reminder of the dangers of letting ones [Rage] overcome reason. The Werewolves are embarassed by their clans' actions. The other Shapeshifters have never forgiven the Werewolves for their folly. Also, many of the Werewolves born of wolves hold deep hatred for the other Werewolves both for their betrayal and for the current state of the wolves in the world."

Created through different means, the Undead share a common trait. Their life is artificial, a soulless parody of true life. Above all they envy the life that they lack, and they may only maintain their unlife by taking life from others.
* Personality - Despite their reputation, the Undead are not innately evil. They retain at least some of their original personalities, but their new existence often forces them to reevaluate their morals. Most of the more 'ethical' Undead end their own miserable existences.
* Spirit - Undead cannot recover Spirit except by stealing it from the living. Slaying the living is always worth 1 extra [Spirit] to any undead. Note: Undead are more connected to the spirit world than the living world and therefore are permanently banished from the living world if their Spirit ever drops to zero. Without a [Spirit], they many never use any [Naturalism] or [Spiritualism] magics.

Types
* Traumatic death - Focused completely on the trauma of their death, they are drawn to the living and end up reenacting their death with others. - Burning Dead, Drowned, Frozen Dead, Scarecrow, Wendigo.
* Incomplete business - These are compelled to attempt to complete their goals. Sometimes the completion of the goal is enough to let them rest. Sometimes they continue endlessly trying to complete an impossible goal. - Shades, Poltergeists

               "* The Tremere is the second youngest clan having appeared in the Dark Ages.
* History - The Tremere began as House Tremere, mages of the Order of Hermes named for their leader and founder, Tremere. At the end of the first millennium, the members of House Tremere realized the Hermetic arts were failing and found its immortality potions no longer working. House Tremere undertook numerous experiments, but it was Goratrix who devised a solution in his investigation of vampires. In 1022, Goratrix invited Tremere and six of the founder's closest advisers to participate in the completed ritual, which promised true immortality. Whether Goratrix knew what would happen is known only by him and, perhaps, Tremere, but at the completion of the ritual the participants fell unconscious and were reborn as vampires, their avatars destroyed and magical abilities lost. The mages had gained their immortality but lost the power they lived for. In time, the Tzimisce made war against House Tremere in retribution for the Fiends that had been made part of Goratrix's experiments. The Order of Hermes also became suspicious of diabolical practices being performed by the increasingly secretive House. In 1037 Tremere gathered the seven newly-made Cainites and forced the blood bond upon them. He then declared to them that House Tremere would be restructured with a new pyramid hierarchy, placing himself at the top as Primus of House and clan Tremere and his seven closest followers forming the Inner Council of Seven directly under him. They would slowly begin Embracing the rest of the House, with each initiate being bound to the Inner Council to ensure their loyalty. In time, all members of House Tremere would die or become vampires. While Tremere and Etrius pursued their own research throughout Europe in converting the hermetic arts into Thaumaturgy, Goratrix once again returned to his laboratories with his apprentices at hand. After years of experimentation on captured Tzimisce, Nosferatu, and Gangrel, he succeeded in creating a Gargoyle in 1121, and by 1125 the hybrids were serving as shock troops against the Fiends. Nevertheless, the Tremere found themselves third-class citizens among the undead. Whatever boldness Tremere had shown in entering the night was ignored by the staunchly traditionalist clans, and they were often forced from cities by princes who did not look kindly on their presumption. As he and Etrius rapidly acquired more vampiric lore they discovered the history of Caine and the Antediluvians, as well as the benefits of diablerie. Seeking to establish themselves as a clan proper, the Tremere sought a clan founder to diablerize and settled on Saulot, the enigmatic founder of the Salubri clan. In 1133, Tremere and the Inner Council discovered Saulot's tomb in the Anatolian desert. Tremere diablerized the Antediluvian and promptly entered torpor, leaving the Inner Council to lead the clan and destroy the remaining Salubri. As with everything else that the Tremere had done to this point, the result was a mixed blessing. The Tremere were entrenched in many Cainite courts, their services as mages making them indispensable to princes across Europe. They were now accepted as one of the Low Clans, albeit considered usurpers, distrusted warlocks, and known diablerists. In the early years of the 21st century, the Intellegence agencies of the United States managed to gain access to SchreckNet and gained firsthand knowledge of the existence of a race of undead bloodsuckers that were spread in all corners of the world. Sharing their knowledge with other intelligence agencies, the united secret services contacted the Vatican, whom they knew to have experience fighting the undead. After years of careful research, the Second Inquisition had targeted Vienna as the 'capital of vampires' and prepared a strike against their headquarters. In 2008, a united USSOCOM and Vatican ESOG force stormed the Vienna Chantry of Clan Tremere and destroyed it, blaming it to an ISIS terror attack to the public. London, Las Vegas, Paris, and Marseilles were largely cleared of vampiric activity, with numerous captured vampires being placed in black sites and experimented upon to discover their weaknesses. The Inner Council of Seven were slain and their Blood Bonds shattered. Since then the once monolithic Tremere structure has completely fallen apart."

* Feeding - Vampires regain Spirit only by drinking the blood of the living. Some Eastern Vampires eat the flesh of the living instead. As the Spirit of a Vampire decreases, the Vampire becomes more savage and beastial.
* Morale - Normal, Low vs. Fire and Sunlight. Ironically, the one thing that truly terrifies these eternal, murderous beings is the end of their own cursed lives.
* Vulnerability to Fire - The cleansing touch of Fire will rapidly consume a Vampire.
* Vulnerability to Sunlight - The cleansing touch of Sunlight will ignite a Vampire on Fire. During daylight hours, Vampires fall into a deathlike sleep. Contrary to some sources, arificial sunlight has no effect on them.
* Vulnerability to Silver - The cleansing touch of Silver will ignite a Vampire on Fire. Even their reflection is destroyed by Silver. Contrary to some sources, non-silver mirrors still reflect the image of a Vampire.
* Immunity to Bleeding - Vampire blood can move on its own and will not leave the body without force.
* Biology - Vampires are created when one Vampire drains a person to the brink of death and then feeds their own blood to the victim. This is called: The Embrace. At this moment, the victim has a chance to reject the Embrace, and die peacefully. If the victim accepts the Embrace, the blood will rapidly reach the victim's heart and the transformation to Vampire will immediately begin.
* Nature - There is much conjecture about how a Vampire functions, but it is certain that the blood of a Vampire is the source of its unnatural existence. Some believe that the blood itself is a form of evil, magical, parasite centered on the heart that animates the Vampire's body.
* Masquerade - During the day, Vampires are completely vulnerable. Therefore, they avoid drawing attention to themselves. They pretend to be normal people while manipulating from behind the scenes. Vampires appear as near perfect humans, but this too is a mask. Vampires pretend at being sophisticated and refined, but always behind this is their true, savage, bestial nature.
* Sire - The vampire's creator.
* Childer - The relationship of a vampire to a Sire.
* Book of Nod - The vampiric history/bible.
* Antitribu - Those who choose to oppose their clan, joining the Camarilla or Sabbat respectively."

                   "* The Tremere is the second youngest clan having appeared in the Dark Ages.
* History - The Tremere began as House Tremere, mages of the Order of Hermes named for their leader and founder, Tremere. At the end of the first millennium, the members of House Tremere realized the Hermetic arts were failing and found its immortality potions no longer working. House Tremere undertook numerous experiments, but it was Goratrix who devised a solution in his investigation of vampires. In 1022, Goratrix invited Tremere and six of the founder's closest advisers to participate in the completed ritual, which promised true immortality. Whether Goratrix knew what would happen is known only by him and, perhaps, Tremere, but at the completion of the ritual the participants fell unconscious and were reborn as vampires, their avatars destroyed and magical abilities lost. The mages had gained their immortality but lost the power they lived for. In time, the Tzimisce made war against House Tremere in retribution for the Fiends that had been made part of Goratrix's experiments. The Order of Hermes also became suspicious of diabolical practices being performed by the increasingly secretive House. In 1037 Tremere gathered the seven newly-made Cainites and forced the blood bond upon them. He then declared to them that House Tremere would be restructured with a new pyramid hierarchy, placing himself at the top as Primus of House and clan Tremere and his seven closest followers forming the Inner Council of Seven directly under him. They would slowly begin Embracing the rest of the House, with each initiate being bound to the Inner Council to ensure their loyalty. In time, all members of House Tremere would die or become vampires. While Tremere and Etrius pursued their own research throughout Europe in converting the hermetic arts into Thaumaturgy, Goratrix once again returned to his laboratories with his apprentices at hand. After years of experimentation on captured Tzimisce, Nosferatu, and Gangrel, he succeeded in creating a Gargoyle in 1121, and by 1125 the hybrids were serving as shock troops against the Fiends. Nevertheless, the Tremere found themselves third-class citizens among the undead. Whatever boldness Tremere had shown in entering the night was ignored by the staunchly traditionalist clans, and they were often forced from cities by princes who did not look kindly on their presumption. As he and Etrius rapidly acquired more vampiric lore they discovered the history of Caine and the Antediluvians, as well as the benefits of diablerie. Seeking to establish themselves as a clan proper, the Tremere sought a clan founder to diablerize and settled on Saulot, the enigmatic founder of the Salubri clan. In 1133, Tremere and the Inner Council discovered Saulot's tomb in the Anatolian desert. Tremere diablerized the Antediluvian and promptly entered torpor, leaving the Inner Council to lead the clan and destroy the remaining Salubri. As with everything else that the Tremere had done to this point, the result was a mixed blessing. The Tremere were entrenched in many Cainite courts, their services as mages making them indispensable to princes across Europe. They were now accepted as one of the Low Clans, albeit considered usurpers, distrusted warlocks, and known diablerists. In the early years of the 21st century, the Intellegence agencies of the United States managed to gain access to SchreckNet and gained firsthand knowledge of the existence of a race of undead bloodsuckers that were spread in all corners of the world. Sharing their knowledge with other intelligence agencies, the united secret services contacted the Vatican, whom they knew to have experience fighting the undead. After years of careful research, the Second Inquisition had targeted Vienna as the 'capital of vampires' and prepared a strike against their headquarters. In 2008, a united USSOCOM and Vatican ESOG force stormed the Vienna Chantry of Clan Tremere and destroyed it, blaming it to an ISIS terror attack to the public. London, Las Vegas, Paris, and Marseilles were largely cleared of vampiric activity, with numerous captured vampires being placed in black sites and experimented upon to discover their weaknesses. The Inner Council of Seven were slain and their Blood Bonds shattered. Since then the once monolithic Tremere structure has completely fallen apart."
