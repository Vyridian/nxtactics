* Like [Undead], they exist partially in the [Spirit Realm], are immune to most hostile environments, and appear blurry in photograph and other recordings.
* If their body is destroyed, their Spirit leaves the body and enters the [Spirit Realm] fully. Their bodies age will rapidly catch up to it usually causing it to deteriorate rapidly. Normally their spirit never returns to the physical world, but if they are powerful enough, they may find their way back through the Veil and even death may not stop them from returning."

           "* Nemesis - Since 1984, a theory attempts to explain the mass extinctions that occur
every 27 million years. The theory submits that a brown dwarf star orbits our sun at
95,000 AUs and every 27 million years it approaches close enough to rain comets throughout
the solar system causing climate change, mass-extinctions, and similar catastrophes.
* Seeds of Azathoth - Nemesis is, in reality, a Spawn of Azathoth that has clung to orbit
around the Sun. Occasionally, pieces of Nemesis break free, falling into the solar
system: the Seeds of Azathoth. Seeds that strike the Sun are destroyed, but if a seed
strikes a planet, it can melt into the planet's core where it grows immensely, eventually
forming a new Spawn which emerges from the broken planet like a snake from an egg. Our
system's original fifth world was so parasitized. Its remnants compose the asteroid belt.
* For millenia, human and other astronomers have seen in comets, 'hairy stars',
approaching disaster and ill-fortune. In ancient texts, comets have been blamed for
the revolt of the Shoggoths against the Elder Things, the doom of the dinosaurs, the
fall of the empire of the Serpent People, the destruction of Hyperborea, the sinking of
Atlantis, and even the two ages of chaos that struck early Egypt.
* The most recent effect of Nemesis took place in central Siberia, June 30, 1908, when a
tremendous explosion rocked the area for hundreds of miles. There was a pillar of fire
and shock waves powerful enough to knock down horses 400 miles away."

they spot the wreck and tug twice again. The divers return to the surface
and describe that the wreck is in only 50 feet of water but is stuck on a
reef hanging over a sharp drop off on one side.
* Coral Outcropping - A protruding coral outcropping has pierced the hold
of the hull. Anyone exploring this area will be the victim of a single
sudden attack by the [Moray Eel] that makes its home here. The attack is
not life threatening, but if the person bleeds the divers will have to
return to the surface for fear of attracting sharks.
* The Drop Off - Anyone foolish enough to explore the deck near the
drop off, suddenly causes a section of the hull to break off and fall into
the drop off. The falling diver can attempt to jump free, failing that he
can scramble to grab the coral reef as he falls, otherwise he slowly falls
30 feet before the coral cuts his air hose and he drowns. The boat pulls
him up, but it will be too late to save him unless he is extremely
accomplished at holding his breath.

still active. The pit reaches about 100 feet before a rock cave-in blocks the
way. Within the pit is a single, strange dolphin.

while the chief is on extended medical leave. He is also a member of a secret
death cult that worships ghouls. His cult was graverobbing for their riturals
when the Father caught them and he was dispensed with. Colin's drinking made
him a convenient scapegoat, so the Detective is constructing circumstantial
evidence to arrest Colin. Later he will arrange for Colin to hang himself in
jail. If the investigators get too close to the cult, he will arrange an
ambush to eliminate them.

heretics held prisoner in vaults below the monastery. They are wild and
degenerate and are guilty of cannibalism. They will be held until they die.
** 1641 - A yellowed document in Spanish describes the construction of the
Castillo de San Marcos that incorporates the catacombs of the old monastery.
A violent french prisoner was transferred to a new cell.
** 1662 - A yellowed document in Spanish describes the horrid state of the
French prisoner. His toes are missing and he limps around his cell scratching
on the walls saying only gibberish. He will be held until he perishes.
** 1682 - A yellowed document in Spanish describes the escape of the french
prisoner. Stones were removed from the wall of the cell and the prisoner
fled into a tiny tunnel behind the wall. After a brief attempt to locate him,
the tunnel was filled, sealing the fate of the horrible prisoner. Drawings
were scratched into the ceiling showing comets and fire raining from the sky.
** 1792 - A religious paphlet describes an ancient evil unloosed by Satan.
They are inhuman but walk among us like men. Many officials of the city, both
past and present, belong to this secret, godless faith.
** February 1890 - A freshly buried body was stolen from a cemetary south of
St. Augustine. No suspects were found.
** May 1927 - Grisly Find at Alligator Farm. Eli Simpson, an employee of the

a severed human foot. No identification was found, and police theorize that
a vagrant snuck onto the farm and fell into the pool. No charges were filed.

not locked. If Mother Thornton hears intruders, she will stay in her room
pretending to be sleeping in a chair. If she is exposed, she throws off the veil
and tries to escape the house. She will leap out the second story window lope
down the street scattering the citizenry. Any disturbance here will have the
police arrive in five minutes where they will arrest anyone in the Thornton

that they killed a deformed and crippled old woman.

dead and is merely propped up. The ambushers try to take the investigators

                   "* The Andaman Islands are a narrow chain of islands 590 miles southeast of India.
* Weather - The temperature is mild and ranges from 64F to 92F. Except for October
and March, the islands are hit by daily monsoons.
* Wildlife - There are no large predatory animals, just all manner of bats, rats,
spiders, turtles, wild pigs, and native cats.
* Population - The natives are primitive Negritoes, belived to have lived here since
the Pleistocene era. Uniquely among modern man, they have no knowledge of fire
building and must continually keep a fire burning. They are divided into 12 tribes
with different dialects of the same language. They have a long reputation as
viscious killers and cannibals. For centuries, shipwrecked sailors had been
systematically slain (but not eaten). Over time, the islands have become safe to
outsiders except in remote areas.
* Port Blair - The British established a penal colony on the islands where convicts
are forced to live and work. The colonly is a primitive jungle colony with a dock,
general store, a wireless, and faily complete medical facilities. Port Blair is also
the only deep water anchorage on the islands, so all ships must dock here.
* Major Ashley Nichols - Major Nichols is the commissioner of the Andamans. He
oversees the trade of exotic lumber, coffee, cocoa, tea, and coconuts. He also
commands a small battalion of Indian solders. Nichols is happy to meet civilized
westerners and will places his services and those of the British Government at their
disposal.
* Arrival - The Andamans are 10,000 miles from America. If the investigators use
Colin's ship, the trip takes 3-4 weeks. If they book other passage, they will have
to travel to Calcutta first.
* Office Records - Major Nichols has nothing to hide and allows full access to the
office records where a report of Cynthia Baxter's abduction can be found. In the
narrative, it is found that although the abductors initially tried to take her by
force, that after a short conversatiion, she agreed to go with them and was returned
safely the next day. Major Nichols has only met Cynthia twice, since she rarely
comes to Port Blair.")

them to Cynthia's clinic 45 miles away. However, he does warn that the two are
criminals, working off their crimes. Worse, there are 2 escaped criminals
known to be in the area. They are desperate killers and could be extremely
dangerous.
* Sikander - A Hindu in his mid-thirties with a wife and three children on the
island. He stole a horse and has served eight years so far but is mostly
trustworthy. He will, however, steal a weapon for protecting his family if he
gets the chance. If successful, he will hide the weapon in the jungle for future
retrieval.
* Mahbub - A Moslem from Delhi who has served twenty years so far for murder. He
speaks little English and is neither garrulous nor energetic.
* The Jungle - The trip to Cynthia's clinic starts on timber roads, then
footpaths, but before the first day is over they are struggling through thick
growths and shallow swamps with no path. The trip takes three days or more, and
the guides prove able servants, doing all the work of setting up camp, building
a fire, and preparing meals.
* The Villiage - A loud buzzing noise emanates from a clearing ahead with a tiny,
abandoned villiage. The buzzing comes from a tree with a crude platform 25 feet
up. Atop the platform is a rotted human form covered in a mass of undulating
insects that are devouring it. Although the Andamanese normally bury their dead,
if a particularly revered chief dies, he is bundled in a tree and the clan abandons
their villiage for three months in reverence. If the body is disturbed, the Jarawan
hunters will track the intruders and attempt to kill them for their blasphemy.
* The Mission - Cynthia has a small wooden building that serves as her clinic
surrounded by the huts of 20 Andamanese. Nearly a mile from the beach can be seen
a 6 mile island covered with dense jungle. If local tribesman believe the island is
evil, and only Cynthia has returned alive from it. The inhabitants of the island
rarely leave, and when they do it is only to kidnap and kill.
* Cynthia Baxter - Cynthia is a large woman, big-boned and slightly overweight. She
is very near-sighted, and her voice is high pitched and squeaky. Cynthia will act
hospitable to strangers, but she is highly suspiscious of those who would appear
at this critical moment in her life. She lost her mother at 8 year old. She nearly
died from a spider bite and 12 and began thinking of becoming a catholic nun.
Instead, with the encouragement of Uncle Julian, she studied medicine in college.
Julian helped her get through medical school, and she is deeply grateful to him. To
impress Julian, she became a medical missionary and travelled to the Adamans in
1913. In 1918, she was kidnapped by the Tcho-Tchos from the small island across the
strait. The Tcho-Tcho priest saw the mark of the spider on her, and trained her in
the nature of Atlach-Nacha, their horrible spider god. Cynthia never had a strong
personality and was easily brainwashed and converted to the terrible worship. The
priest has convinced her that she has a special detiny (which is horribly true),
and now only Julian might be able to turn her from her path.
* Cynthia's Journal - In her hut is a journal that describes her facination with the
teachings of the Tcho-Tcho priest and her belief that a new sun shall appear in the
sky. The journal describes the arrival of Silas Patterson and his interest in the
Tcho-Tcho rituals. She also writes of her mixed feeling about sending the 'present'
to her father, but the priest insists that he cannot be allowed to interfere.")

come. He sends men in the night to meet with Cynthia, and she eagarly goes with
them. The local Adamanese raise an alarm and many flickering torch lights can
be seen from the island.
* Tcho Tcho Tribesman - The Tcho Tcho are more asian in appearance than the average
Adaman. They are all violent fanatics and will hunt down and capture anyone who
invades their island. There are 10 males, 6 females, and 3 children on the
island.
* Tcho Tcho Priest - The Tcho Tcho priest leads his tribe. He is a long time
explorer in the Dreamlands and there he has the form of a twisted dwarf (reflecting
his personality). In combat, the priest stands back and casts spells (Dread
Curse of Azathoth and Withered Limb) while his comrades fight and die.
* Fossil Quarry - An exposed rock in the jungle is covered with fossils of
prehistoric arthopods including millipedes, scorpions, and spiders. This rock is
the source of the spider from the Baxter home, brought to life by the Child of
Atlach-Nacha spell cast by the Tcho Tcho priest. A single enormous spider
six-feet across can be found here, and the priest will animate this spider if
he gets the chance. Note: Any damaged fossil cannot be reanimated.
* Obelisk - In a clearing near the villiage rises a black stone, twenty foot
monolith. Though weathered by time, precise geometric designs are clearly
visible. These designs are are disturbing to the eye and create a sense of
vertigo. Out of the corner of one's eye, they seem to swirl and pulse. If one
listens to the stone an almost impercetible rhythmic throbbing can be heard.
Crude stones are set up around the obelisk covered in primitive drawings of
spiders chasing and consuming tiny humans as shooting stars fall from the
heavens.
* Metamorphosis - On the night Cynthia is 'kidnapped', she goes directly to
the Obelisk. There the tribesmen have gathered to begin the ceremony. Near the
Obelisk are bound the 2 escaped killers that Major Nichols warned of as well
as any other captured males. Cynthia stands before the altar, removes her
clothes and sways to the Tcho Tcho songs. Eventually, she stops, bends over,
and the skin along her back splits wide open, revealing a shiny black surface
that pulses horribly. As the wrinkling empty skin of Cynthia Baxter is pushed
forward, multple legs spill out from the discarded molt, waving feebly, as the
huge spider-thing pushes clear. The priest dones Cynthia's discarded skin and
wears it like a coat.
* The Wedding Feast - Cynthia's new form is not hard enough to move freely
until dawn. In the meantime, she is ceremonially wedded to the male sacrifices
before she drags herself to each one and begins eating the flesh from the
victims head. She finally sucks the brains out through the eyesockets. Each
feast takes 20 minutes, and after each is consumed, the still animate corpses
with exposed skulls are freed and shamble mindlessly off into the forest. The
Onge people sense the threat of the Tcho Tcho and attack the Tcho Tcho. The
Tcho Tcho defend Cynthia and the priest as they escape. The Onge will not
pursue the Tcho Tcho into jungle at night. Instead the free any remaining
prisoners and wait for light. The priest makes his way to the prehistoric rock
and casts Child of Atlach-Nacha to animate the giant spider there.
* Daughter of Atlach-Nacha - At dawn, Cynthia is fully formed and begins a
3 hour trek across the island to the Caverns of Atlach-Nacha. She is
accompanied by hordes of spiders that crawl around and over her. Any who
follow will constantly be treading on spiders and have spiders dropping upon
them from the trees. Their bites are painful but are not dangerous.
* Caverns of Atlach-Nacha - Cynthia travels to a 20 foot cave opening where
her father dwells. If she is pursued, she will wait in ambush for her pursuers.
If the investigators are foolish enough to continue searching, they will
travel through twisting caverns deeper and deeper for over an hour before the
cave opens into a vast chasm nearly filled with thick, ropy webs. Continued
activity attracts [Atlach-Nacha] himself who resembles a hideous, black, hairy
spider with a strange, remotely human-like face with little red, hair-rimmed
eyes.")))

is watching them from a distance. If anyone approaches, his head disappears
in a cloud of mist and then he vanishes.
* Procession of Burgomaster Kranon - Trumpets announce a parade throught the
streets for Burgomaster Kranon. The Burgomaster is immediately recognizable
as Matthew, Julian Baxter's ward. In the Dreamlands, his emotional and mental
handicaps don't exist. If the investigators can get an audience, Krannon can
be convinced to help them, both here and in the real world.
* Cthaat Aquadingen - At the [Library at Ultar], the investigators can
search for the [Cthaat Aquadingen]. The book is bound in soft, human skin,
still pliable, and always moist from perspiration welling from its pores.
Simply handling the book is creepy. Within the book can be found a quote:
The stars fall, the beast bred of stone rampages, and a time of great change
comes. Deep within perfumed Kled, where life turns to death, the Watcher in
the Glade knows the time and place of the coming. Chinese notes are written
in the margin of the page. If they are translated, they comment that the
Pnankotic Manuscripts mentions the Watcher in the Glade.
* Pnakotic Manuscripts - If read, the manuscripts describe that the Watcher
in the Glade is the Great Old One Yibb-Tstil. Priests of Yibb-Tstil meet at
the great pool in front of the ivory palace. Priests then grovel on hands and
knees before Yibb-Tstil and must not look upon him.

barker announces that they have the only captive Colossal purple spider from
the distant north. Admission is a dime or anything of value. The interior of
the tent is larger than the outside would suggest, and in a barred cage at
the back of the tent is a purple spider the size of a car hovering over the
dessicated body of a sheep. If anyone tries to talk to the spider, it speaks
in a thin, dry voice. It is, however, not helpful and eventually hisses. The
barker comes running in and ushers them out. If they want to speak more, the
barker says: 'It is not up to me you see'. The spider then says: 'After all, I
am the master here.' If the barker is questioned about the dwarf who works
here, he tells them the dwarf quit some time ago and headed to Kled.")

Enchanted Wood to Thran. At Thran a elephant caravan can be taken over land or
a river boat can be taken to Hlanith where passage on a ship can be found to
Kled.
* Numerous ivory palaces dot the jungles. If the dreamers ask about the great
pool mentioned in the Pnakotic Manuscripts, the guides recognize it as the
Palace of the Sacred Fount.
* Palace of the Sacred Fount - The palaces is one of the less feared locations,
though it is still avoided. As with other ivory palaces in Kled, the palace
is somehow physically in perfect condition though the rooms are empty and the
floors are thick with dirt and leaves. The smell in the area is a unique musky
odor that immediately reminds the dreamers of the smell during the dream of
the death of Phillip Baxter. The front hallway is an atrium where rain water
falls to collect in a rectangular pool. At the far end of the pool stands a
huge jade statue of an evil-looking hyena. The statue leers with gaping jaws
over the pool. The apparently bottomless pool is dark and filthly from rotting
leaves, a peculiar oily film covers its surface. Despite its appearance the
pool is not dangerous.
* Phillip's Ghost - A distant cackling sound can be heard. Following the
sound, the dreamers find a stairway going down many flights with torchlight
below. At the bottom of the stairs, the dreamers find a torchlit hallway with
a cell at the end. Within a cackling dwarf uses a human femur to visciously
beat a glowing, partially headless, staggering figure. The dwarf is hunched
and misshapen and has a terrible, inhuman face. Its lips are drawn into a
snarl over three-inch fangs. Its eyes are glowing red pits. The figure is
the dreamform of Phillip Baxter. If he is rescued, his headless form is
mindless and helpless. The dwarf with not help under any circumstances.
* Path to Yib-Tstll - Behind the Palace the jungle becomes stunted and
twisted, tree trunks are bent at odd angles, and a general sense of
disease pervades the growth. Futher on, alien foliage begins to appear
including quivering fungi and twisting weird ferns. Further still, a
great stone arch can be seen surrounded by dead trees. Through the arch
can be seen another alien jungle evidently on a far-off world. The arch
is clearly a permanent gate, and plants and insects can be seen crossing
both ways as if the arch were simple stone.
* World of Yib-Tstll - Beyond the arch, the sky is dark green and
starless. Swollen insects swoop ominously from deadly-looking blooms.
Flying horrors with veinous wings fly high above. Not far away, a vast,
black clearing is visible.
* The Clearing - The clearing is roughly a mile across. The black surface
is composed of fine flakes like snow, but it is warm to the touch. If the
dreamers heed the Pnakotic Manuscripts, they should crawl on hands and
knees across the black clearing facing the ground to avoid actually seeing
Yibb-Tstll. As the dreamers near the center, Yib-Tstll rises suddenly
from the black clearing. Dreamers may attempt to avert their gaze or
suffer the madness induced by his presence.
* [Yibb-Tstll] - The massive being speaks telepathically with a booming
alien voice. Each dreamer must make a [Spirit] test or Yibb-Tstll will
ignore that person completely. If the test is completely failed,
Yibb-Tstll will touch the person and impart its feared reversal.
Yibb-Tstll is suprisingly helpful and will answer questions about the
Cthulhu Mythos and things of cosmic import including Nemesis, but he will
only give a single answer on a subject and will not clarify himself.
* Reversals - Any dreamer who suffers a reversal will instantly be
driven insane or his human form or dream form will be permanently killed.
If an insane dreamer is brought to him, Yibb-Tstll will fully restore
his sanity. If the dwarf is present, Yibb-Tstll will reverse him, and his
dream form will change into the Tcho-Tcho priest while his real form will
become the dwarf. If the headless form and the ghoul's page are brought
before him, he touches them both and Phillip Baxter's dream fomr is
restored, but back in the real world, Silas Patterson has become a mad
imitation of Phillip Baxter.
* Web of Eibon - Yibb-Tstll instructed Eibon in his construction of the
Web of Eibon spell with which he planned to freeze time around Nemesis
(and Earth) to prevent Earth's destruction. Yibb-Tstll knows his efforts
will fail in the end, but it provided the instructions anyway.")

night the investigators find themselves having hazy dreams of the
graveyard at St. Augustine. Suddenly, the dream sharpens and 3 figures
start crawling from an open grave: ghouls like the ones that may have
been seen at St. Augustine. The ghouls stinking breath reeks of death and
decay. The ghouls do not appear to be hostile, instead they start urging
the investigators to come with them to see the wise man and there is
little time left before dawn. A terrific stench issues from the open
grave. Below rotten bits of wood and fabric lie on the grave floor and a
narrow, twisting tunnel leads into darkness. The ghouls gibber that they
must hurry and start climbing down the hole. If the dreamers don't follow
the tunnel begins to slowly close. If the dreamers still do not follow,
they awake normally, but the opportunity to learn more has been lost. If
they do follow, the tunnel collapses behind them and they will have to
follow the ghouls forward.
* Grath the Leader - Young and handsome by ghoul standards, Grath leads
the group and most often speaks with the dreamers. He had a riding zebra,
but the group got hungry and ate most of it.
* Mairpl the Big - Mairpl is much larger than the others, speaks little,
and wields a club in battle.
* Ug the Hungry - The worst and most degenerate of them, Ug speak no
human language and spends most of his time on four legs. He avoids the
humans, but can often be seen staring and drooling over them. He possess
no threat, but he likes to fantasize.
* The Page - At the end of the tunnel waits the Page. The Page is wrapped
in a dirty brown cloak with his face hidden. His body is bent forward
and staggers under the weight of an enormous tombstone chained to his
back. The ghouls order the Page around and play viscious practical jokes
on him. Below the hood can be found Sila Patterson's face, though it
shows no recognition. Upon the tombstone is written 'Phillip A. Baxter
1865-1925.' The Page is, of course, the dream form of Silas Patterson,
suffering from the guilt of the death of his friend.
* The Quest - The ghoul gang seeks to rescue a female ghoul Horella who
has disappeared. The ghouls are fairly melodramatic about how beautiful
she is and how they must rescue her from whatever peril she is in. To
find Horella, they seek the insight of the wise Man of the Mountain. This
man supposedly is very wise and will answer any questions.
* Social Ettiquette - After a few hours of travel, the ghouls stop for
nourishment. They squat down and rummage through their stained sacks.
They produce vaguely familiar cuts of raw meat with tinges of green along
with sour wine. The source of the meat is all too obvious. The ghouls
like their food well-aged and, out of respect, offer their guests the
oldest pieces. The bags also contain the remains of Grath's zebra which
the ghouls are more than happy to hand over, leaving the tastier pieces
for themselves.")

their way. Drinking water oozes down the rock wall. Bloated fungi, pale,
foot-long crickets, and eyeless carnivorous rats server as food. Most of
the trip is in complete darkness. Occasionally, luminescent fungi provide
a tiny amount of light. The tunnels connect the Vaults of Zin where
dangerous ghasts, serpent folk, or worse may be encountered. Eventually,

in about an hour. As they draw near, it is clear that the man is enormous,
towering over the horse. He is 8 feet tall, 400 lbs, and dressed all in
black. His horse seems old and tired and lags behind being pulled by a
rope. The horse is an elderly nag with cataract films covering both eyes.

stop walking unless he is attacked. This being is the dream-form of Eibon.

goes then, he does not know for the horse shall be the master. He freely
discusses his trip across the desert, Mythos knowledge, Nemesis, and his
spell the Web of Eibon that Yibb-Tstl taught him. He now knows that
stagnation is worse than destruction by Nemesis. If asked about Nemesis,
he produces a large, shining jewel from the air and offers it to the
dreamers. He says simply that all brave souls will know what to do when
the time comes. Any attempt to attack Eibon results in him disappearing
and reappearing far in the distance continuing his endless travels.")

see the holy man and ask where Horella is being kept. The other ghouls
will wait here while Mairpl and any brave dreamers attempt the climb.
The way up seems somewhat trecherous and will require a [Climb] roll to
succeed. If that roll fails, a second [Climb] roll must be made to catch
yourself before you fall to your doom. Unfortunately, Mairpl fails both
rolls and falls far below splattering on the rocks and potentially
injuring those below. After a short period of remorse, Grath and Ug

yellow robe sits on a heap of corpses plundered from the cemetary below.
He deftly uses a silver hatchet to cut pieces of the corpses and flings
the dripping gobbets above his head as the circling Byakhees swoop down
to catch them from the air. As the dreamers approach, the Byakhee scream
and chatter, but the man pays them no mind. If hailed, he smiles warmly,
and if asked questions he will honestly answer based on his vast
knowledge of the Dreamlands and the Mythos. Knowledge comes at a price,
so before he answers each question, he hurls his hatchet at the questioner
which instantly slices off an appendage, starting with a hand. The Byakhee
swoop down and eat the tidbit. The wound does not bleed and only hurts for
a moment. The damage is permanent in the Dreamlands, but each time a
dreamer returns to the Dreamlands one wound is healed. If asked, he tells
that Horella is at the castle of Bombel, the giant, in the hills to the
east of the [Stony Desert]. Anyone foolish enough to attach the man, is

penetrate it. If anyone enters, a few seconds later, horrifying screams
of agony echo from the cave accompanied by sucking, popping sounds and
a soft, cooing voice. The screams continue for almost a minute before
they are choked off by a gurgling, bubbling sound and a huge spray of

days through the desert and another day throught wooded hills.

single window at the top and a door at the bottom.
* Bombel - Near the castle, sitting on a boulder is a huge [Gug]. At the
first sign of intruders, it rushes to the attack.
* Horella - Shortly after Bombel starts fighting, a foul-looking, scaly
ghoul appears in the window. This is Horella, and she immediately begins
hurling vile insults and rocks at the Gug. The ghouls are cheered on by
her presence, but if someone listens they realize that she is exhorting
Bombel to kill the intruders. Dreamers may also notice previous bruises
on Bombel's head. If Bombel falls, Horella turns her insults and rocks
at her would-be rescuers. Any remaining ghouls grab a chain from their
bags, say 'To the rescue', capture Horella, and drag her bumping down
the stairs. The ghouls bid farewell and will offer the page as a reward

                  :summary
                   "* Francis Wilson - Francis is one of the Tuesday Night Academy. He was at Phillip's funeral and he has been in Russia researching the Tunguska Blast and its possible relationship to Nemesis. He has made some discoveries and sends a telegram to Judge Braddock who forwards it along. The message says to leave immediately for Darjeeling, India and to meet Colonel Hugh Huntley of the British Foreign Office.
* Darjeeling -
* Colonel Hugh Huntley - Francis has arranged with the British Foreign Office to allow the investigators to travel to Lhasa, Tibet to aid him in his research. Colonel Huntley provides them with papers and can help arrange transport to the British Legation in Lhasa where Francis Wilson is staying.
* Road to Lhasa - The 400 mile journey to Lhasa can only be taken on foot or via horse-drawn caravan. The route is heavily trafficked by pilgrims, traders, smugglers, and spies. The journey takes weeks and is alternately terrifying, boring, facinating, cold, and misery-making.
* Lhasa - Lhasa is a sprawling squat city with no building taller than 2 stories except for the Potala, the home of the Dalai Lama. The Potala is a bulky, stone structure that is imposing but unattractive.
* The British Legation - The Legation is on the outskirts of Lhasa. Here Francis Wilson has residence. He seems thinner and more stressed than at the funeral. He has been researching the Tunguska Blast and mad Rasputin's apparent presence at the blast. After piecing together his research, he illegally entered the Soviet Union and stole parts of Rasputin's journal. He then fled to Tibet through Mongolia. He has been translating sections since then. He claims that Rasputin met someone called Eibon in his dreams, and that this Eibon told him of his own death. Eibon also warned him of a dark star that would fall from the sky. This Eibon gave him a stone that he used to destoy the star. He further foretells another dark star that would fall long after Rasputin's death in Tibet. Francis guesses that the location may be near an abandoned temple roughly 300 miles north of Lhasa. He has found a guide Lha-bzang who studied in the temple as a child.
* Lha-bzang - Francis plans to travel there soon with a native Tibetan, Lha-bzang. Lha-bzang is a domden, a Tibetan mortician. A skilled Anthropologist may recall that Tibetan funeral rites involve the corpse being hacked to bits by the axe-wielding domden and then fed to ravens or vultures. Lha-bzang's dream form is the holy man on the mountain. Lha-bzang is going on the journey to expand his spiritual understanding. Unfortunately, he has also been paid off by a Soviet spy. If questioned about the temple, he says he was sold as a slave as a child but he fled the temple when he realized that their teachings were not Buddhist.
* Ivan Dorkyev - A Soviet spy who has been tracking Francis down since Francis stole Rasputin's journal in Leningrad. He is over 6 feet tall and is dressed in the tattered robes of a yak-herder. Beneath, he carries two pistols, a knife, and a bandolier of ammo. He hides at his camp in the mountains near the ruins waiting for Lha-bzang to bring Francis.
* Trip to the Ruins - Lha-bzang leads the expedition 300 miles through a tangle of steep mountain passes, brackish lakes, and arid valleys. On the way, they encounter kay-herders, small mountain monasteries, and moutain farms. About 2 weeks in to the trip, while camped, a minor earth tremor shakes everyone awake. A week laker, they arrive at the Nenmka temple, sitting on the slope of a mountain.
* The Temple - The temple is now just a windswept ruin. A Mythos knowledge test reveals that the fallen columns have inscriptions used to invoke Hastur. The Soviet spy has watched the investigators approach and waits in hiding nearby. Lha-bzang finds a section of flooring with symbols on a tile. Here he will perform a ceremony to discover more about Nemesis.
* The Ceremony - Lha-bzang sits and lights a clay pipe containing a tarball of hashish. He passes the pipe around and then begins a droning wail. After 30 minutes, he retrieves a knife and a freshly severed human hand from his bag. He cuts his own palm, smears blood on the hand, and binds the cut. He then passes the knife to each person to do the same. If any will not, he gestures for them to leave the prayer circle. After another 5 minutes, the hand twitches and then turns toward Lha-bzang. He asks where can they find the Seed of Nemesis. The hand then crawls to a symbols on the ground indicating 'not far' and 'north-east'. Additional questions may be asked but each question causes the questioner to receive a minor Sanity Wound. Answers are always very short, and the hand only knows local events. The Soviet spy waits nearby but has accepted Lha-bzang's demand to allow the ceremony to complete before acting.
* Confrontation - Just as the ceremony is concluded, Ivan steps into the room brandishing his pistols and warning everyone to stay where they are. He is deadly serious and will gun down anyone who makes sudden movements. Ivan plans to take Francis back to the Soviet Union to stand trial for the many laws he has broken and suspiscion of being a spy. He has no knowledge of Nemesis and has nothing but contempt for the superstitious, religious ritual. If given the chance, he will tie up the investigators and then take Francis and Lha-bzang (his ally) in the morning.
* The Fallen Seed - In the early morning, everything changes. Along with the bright sun, a halo forms in the sky, though this halo does not surround anything visible, yet. Dorkyev is thunder-struck; he and Francis exchange words in Russian. Ever the pragmatist, Dorkyev frees everyone and begins a descent toward the valley under the halo. Within the valley, the halo light is flat and oily, and its color melts through shades of yellow and green as though through a prism. Lha-bzang vomits and flees. Suddenly, all present feel their hair stand on end as the halo darkens and takes on a dull gun-metal hue. The slight wind disappears and everything is silent. Then, high above a sizzling sound grows in intensity. Suddenly a hideous scream is heard followed by a thunderous blast that knocks everyone off their feet. Everyone suffer partial hearing loss and if a check versus [Body] is completely failed, the loss is permanent. A blinding light rips through the sky and crashes to Earth over the valley ridge that Lha-bzang crossed. A massive explosion rocks the ground and a curtain of flame passes overhead. If not for the ridge, everyone would have been incinerated along with Lha-bzang.
* Crater - Peeking over the ridge, a 20 foot crater can be seen with a sickly, green light emanating from it. Wilson frantically says that Eibon's symbol must be placed on the Seed or it will destroy the Earth. Those who have witnessed the Seed in Montana know that any who approach the Seed will die: quickly or slowly. If no one volunteers and no one has a plan, Dorkyev swears, snears of their cowardice, and takes the jewel to the crater. Alas, just as he climbs the crater and is exposed to the light, he screams and immediately melts into a puddle before everyone's horrified sight. Worse, he drops the jewel into the crater. If someone uses a mirror, they can see the jewel near the Seed which is slowly melting the rock around it with its terrible power. Wilson adamantly refuses to go (and will melt if pushed), so someone will have to sacrifice themself or watch the Seed sink into the ground and doom the world.
* Eye to Azathoh - The doomed person must resist the corrupting rays, retrieve the jewel, and then touch it to the Seed. Nothing happens for a few moments, then the Seed suddenly shimmers and disappers with a sharp pop. The Seed is gone but a black, marble tunnel lies in its place. The jewel lies on the ground before the tunnel. Hyperborean symbols line the tunnel. This is Eibon's work. When the jewel crosses the threshold, it suddenly reverts to the heavy glowing stone from the Dreamlands. There is a steady breeze down the tunnel and a light can be seen ahead. After 100 meters, a room 250 meter, circular opens up. The room is the exact same shape as the jewel. The breeze has become a howling gale ending in a 5 meter gateway in the center of the other end of the room. The gateway in the center of the oval room gives the impression of an eye looking out into space.
* Gateway - The gateway can be reached by a ramp that slopes upward 50 meters. Stars can clearly be seen through the opening, and it is clear that the gate leads directly into outer space. Anyone who has been exposed to the Seed radiance, has an intense desire to go through the gate and join Nemesis. Anyone approaching the gate will need ropes or climbing skill to cling to the reliefs on the floor or be sucked into oblivion. Also, the jewel gains weight as it approaches the gate, as if it is resisting, eventually becoming over 100lbs. If someone can get close or has binoculars, that person will see that the area of space beyond the portal is filled with criss-crossing black lines forming a faint web. Someone may recognize the black substance and The Black associated with Yibb-Tsll. This is Eibon's Web taught to him by Yibb-Tsll. Within the web, an observers intuitively senses that time is slowing to a crawl. Further, the web is creeping through the portal into our world. This is how mad Eibon hoped to save mankind, by freezing us forever in time, so Nemesis can never destroy us.
* The End - If the jewel is brought near the gate, in addition to its increased weight, the Black lines start to reach toward the jewel. Simply hurling the jewel through the portal will gather all the webs onto the jewel which breaks the spell of Eibon. If anyone returns to the Stony Desert, they will no longer find Eibon there. The world will no longer be trapped forever in frozen time, but Nemesis will still return some day to end the world, but it will not be today."))))

Cynthia Baxter, Julian's niece in the Andaman Islands. In 1920, he came to Providence
where he met Phillip and joined the Tuesday Night Academy. Phillip soon after helped
him get a teaching position at Brown.
* Silas practices a form of cannibalism he learned in New Guinea at the instruction
of a degenerate Tcho-Tcho priest. The ceremony involves eating the brains of a
recently slain primate to gain extended life. This habit made him lose his job at
Brown when it was discovered that he was stealing monkey corpse from the lab. He has
since made an arrangement with a local undertaker with low moral character, Alvin
Beswick. Silas told Beswick that he was performing brain research, but Beswick is
just concerned with the money. Beswick allows him access to closed coffin corpses
for a price. He was given access to Phillip's corpse and noticed the small bite marks
on the scalp. While devouring the brain, Phillip suddenly lurched back to
consciousness and thrased wilding before dying. Silas was terrified and is wracked
with guilt over his friend's death. He is maintaining his sanity through denial, and
if he is forced to confront what he has done, he will retreat inward and become
catatonic and need to be institutionalized.

every 27 million years. The theory submits that a brown dwarf star orbits our sun at
95,000 AUs and every 27 million years it approaches close enough to rain comets throughout
the solar system causing climate change, mass-extinctions, and similar catastrophes.
* Seeds of Azathoth - Nemesis is, in reality, a Spawn of Azathoth that has clung to orbit
around the Sun. Occasionally, pieces of Nemesis break free, falling into the solar
system: the Seeds of Azathoth. Seeds that strike the Sun are destroyed, but if a seed
strikes a planet, it can melt into the planet's core where it grows immensely, eventually
forming a new Spawn which emerges from the broken planet like a snake from an egg. Our
system's original fifth world was so parasitized. Its remnants compose the asteroid belt.
* For millenia, human and other astronomers have seen in comets, 'hairy stars',
approaching disaster and ill-fortune. In ancient texts, comets have been blamed for
the revolt of the Shoggoths against the Elder Things, the doom of the dinosaurs, the
fall of the empire of the Serpent People, the destruction of Hyperborea, the sinking of
Atlantis, and even the two ages of chaos that struck early Egypt.
* The most recent effect of Nemesis took place in central Siberia, June 30, 1908, when a
tremendous explosion rocked the area for hundreds of miles. There was a pillar of fire
and shock waves powerful enough to knock down horses 400 miles away."

offer the characters 50% of the profits if they chip in the money.

Esmerelda. Father Garcia is friendly but guarded. With the help of
Esmerelda he admits that he fears that someone is watching him. He also
admits to seeing figures moving in the dark on the church grounds, though

bought and retrofitted for large scale salvage. The crew is mostly Cubans
and blacks. As they depart, someone spots a reflection from the coast.
Using binoculars, they see someone observing them back with binoculars
before the person ducks away.
* The Voyage - The map shows a location off Bimini, 300 miles south of St.
Augustine. The voyage takes less than 24 hours on calm seas.
* Diving - The diving pumps have enough pressure for no more than 2 divers
at once. Wolff operates the pumps. Colin would prefer to dive with a
partner and asks for volunteers. The divers reach the bottom in 2 minutes
and tug twice on the line to indicate they are at bottom. The water is
particularly clear and well illuminated by sunlight. Only 20 minutes later
they spot the wreck and tug twice again. The divers return to the surface
and describe that the wreck is in only 50 feet of water but is stuck on a
reef hanging over a sharp drop off on one side.
* Coral Outcropping - A protruding coral outcropping has pierced the hold
of the hull. Anyone exploring this area will be the victim of a single
sudden attack by the [Moray Eel] that makes its home here. The attack is
not life threatening, but if the person bleeds the divers will have to
return to the surface for fear of attracting sharks.
* The Drop Off - Anyone foolish enough to explore the deck near the
drop off, suddenly causes a section of the hull to break off and fall into
the drop off. The falling diver can attempt to jump free, failing that he
can scramble to grab the coral reef as he falls, otherwise he slowly falls
30 feet before the coral cuts his air hose and he drowns. The boat pulls
him up, but it will be too late to save him unless he is extremely
accomplished at holding his breath.
* Captain's Cabin - Colin is most interested in the Captain's cabin where
he finds a heavy lock box which needs to be winched to the surface. In it
there can be found 22 forty pound silver bars worth $10000 total and a
strange, large necklace. The necklace is carved with strange figures of
animalistic humans celebrating a great comet with a tail that goes on
forever. After a few days investigation, it is clear that the wreck does
not contain the riches that Colin hoped for. Colin will be left deeply in
debt. However, any characters who invested will double their investment.")

sunken ruin whose stone ceiling lies just below the water line. No
treasure is found, but Colin is desperate to find anything of value, so he
moves to explore the Ruins.
* Temple - The ruin is a stone temple in a bowl shaped depression with curved
steps going down 20 feet before entering an archway. The temple itself is only
30 feet across and has many crabs and octopi. The walls are covered by mosaic
tile that depicts people suffering during multiple terrible disasters. Above
each disaster are tiles depicting an orb with a shining light nearby.

projecting from one side at the end of which is a shiny topaz. The rod can
orbit the orb and telescope in or out, but its current position is very close
to the orb. A mechanism inside the orb operates the rod and is apparently
still active. The pit reaches about 100 feet before a rock cave-in blocks the
way. Within the pit is a single, strange dolphin.
* The Dolphin - If multiple lights are shined down the pit, a motionless
dolphin can be seen. Suddenly, the normally peaceful dolphin swims up and
attempts to ram people with incredible force. It will continue attacking

investigators went to the library. Witnesses say that Colin and Wolff
returned drunk later that night and ransacked the library. That morning the
priest was found in the church with his skull crushed. The reality is that
the ghoul cult has been robbing graves for years. Father Garcia has been
noticing activity in the night and has been hiding in the church at night to
try to catch someone in the act. Unfortunately, he found the graverobbers and
confronted them. They immediately killed him and called the Detective to
cover up the murder. What the killers did not realize was that Esmerelda was
coming home from the speakeasy when she heard a commotion from the church.
She rushed over and observed the killers discussing what to do with the
Father's body.

while the chief is on extended medical leave. He is also a member of a secret
death cult that worships ghouls. His cult was graverobbing for their riturals
when the Father caught them and he was dispensed with. Colin's drinking made
him a convenient scapegoat, so the Detective is constructing circumstantial
evidence to arrest Colin. Later he will arrange for Colin to hang himself in
jail. If the investigators get too close to the cult, he will arrange an
ambush to eliminate them.
* Esmerelda - Esmerelda is conspicuously missing. After witnessing the murder
scene, she packed her things and fled to her parents house in Clearwater.

heretics held prisoner in vaults below the monastery. They are wild and
degenerate and are guilty of cannibalism. They will be held until they die.
** 1641 - A yellowed document in Spanish describes the construction of the
Castillo de San Marcos that incorporates the catacombs of the old monastery.
A violent french prisoner was transferred to a new cell.
** 1662 - A yellowed document in Spanish describes the horrid state of the
French prisoner. His toes are missing and he limps around his cell scratching
on the walls saying only gibberish. He will be held until he perishes.
** 1682 - A yellowed document in Spanish describes the escape of the french
prisoner. Stones were removed from the wall of the cell and the prisoner
fled into a tiny tunnel behind the wall. After a brief attempt to locate him,
the tunnel was filled, sealing the fate of the horrible prisoner. Drawings
were scratched into the ceiling showing comets and fire raining from the sky.
** 1792 - A religious paphlet describes an ancient evil unloosed by Satan.
They are inhuman but walk among us like men. Many officials of the city, both
past and present, belong to this secret, godless faith.
** February 1890 - A freshly buried body was stolen from a cemetary south of
St. Augustine. No suspects were found.
** May 1927 - Grisly Find at Alligator Farm. Eli Simpson, an employee of the

a severed human foot. No identification was found, and police theorize that
a vagrant snuck onto the farm and fell into the pool. No charges were filed.

and March, the islands are hit by daily monsoons.
* Wildlife - There are no large predatory animals, just all manner of bats, rats,
spiders, turtles, wild pigs, and native cats.
* Population - The natives are primitive Negritoes, belived to have lived here since
the Pleistocene era. Uniquely among modern man, they have no knowledge of fire
building and must continually keep a fire burning. They are divided into 12 tribes
with different dialects of the same language. They have a long reputation as
viscious killers and cannibals. For centuries, shipwrecked sailors had been
systematically slain (but not eaten). Over time, the islands have become safe to
outsiders except in remote areas.
* Port Blair - The British established a penal colony on the islands where convicts
are forced to live and work. The colonly is a primitive jungle colony with a dock,
general store, a wireless, and faily complete medical facilities. Port Blair is also
the only deep water anchorage on the islands, so all ships must dock here.

footpaths, but before the first day is over they are struggling through thick
growths and shallow swamps with no path. The trip takes three days or more, and
the guides prove able servants, doing all the work of setting up camp, building
a fire, and preparing meals.
* The Villiage - A loud buzzing noise emanates from a clearing ahead with a tiny,
abandoned villiage. The buzzing comes from a tree with a crude platform 25 feet
up. Atop the platform is a rotted human form covered in a mass of undulating
insects that are devouring it. Although the Andamanese normally bury their dead,
if a particularly revered chief dies, he is bundled in a tree and the clan abandons
their villiage for three months in reverence. If the body is disturbed, the Jarawan
hunters will track the intruders and attempt to kill them for their blasphemy.
* The Mission - Cynthia has a small wooden building that serves as her clinic
surrounded by the huts of 20 Andamanese. Nearly a mile from the beach can be seen
a 6 mile island covered with dense jungle. If local tribesman believe the island is
evil, and only Cynthia has returned alive from it. The inhabitants of the island
rarely leave, and when they do it is only to kidnap and kill.
* Cynthia Baxter - Cynthia is a large woman, big-boned and slightly overweight. She
is very near-sighted, and her voice is high pitched and squeaky. Cynthia will act
hospitable to strangers, but she is highly suspiscious of those who would appear
at this critical moment in her life. She lost her mother at 8 year old. She nearly
died from a spider bite and 12 and began thinking of becoming a catholic nun.
Instead, with the encouragement of Uncle Julian, she studied medicine in college.
Julian helped her get through medical school, and she is deeply grateful to him. To
impress Julian, she became a medical missionary and travelled to the Adamans in
1913. In 1918, she was kidnapped by the Tcho-Tchos from the small island across the
strait. The Tcho-Tcho priest saw the mark of the spider on her, and trained her in
the nature of Atlach-Nacha, their horrible spider god. Cynthia never had a strong
personality and was easily brainwashed and converted to the terrible worship. The
priest has convinced her that she has a special detiny (which is horribly true),
and now only Julian might be able to turn her from her path.
* Cynthia's Journal - In her hut is a journal that describes her facination with the
teachings of the Tcho-Tcho priest and her belief that a new sun shall appear in the
sky. The journal describes the arrival of Silas Patterson and his interest in the
Tcho-Tcho rituals. She also writes of her mixed feeling about sending the 'present'

them. The local Adamanese raise an alarm and many flickering torch lights can
be seen from the island.
* Tcho Tcho Tribesman - The Tcho Tcho are more asian in appearance than the average
Adaman. They are all violent fanatics and will hunt down and capture anyone who
invades their island. There are 10 males, 6 females, and 3 children on the
island.
* Tcho Tcho Priest - The Tcho Tcho priest leads his tribe. He is a long time
explorer in the Dreamlands and there he has the form of a twisted dwarf (reflecting
his personality). In combat, the priest stands back and casts spells (Dread
Curse of Azathoth and Withered Limb) while his comrades fight and die.
* Fossil Quarry - An exposed rock in the jungle is covered with fossils of
prehistoric arthopods including millipedes, scorpions, and spiders. This rock is
the source of the spider from the Baxter home, brought to life by the Child of
Atlach-Nacha spell cast by the Tcho Tcho priest. A single enormous spider
six-feet across can be found here, and the priest will animate this spider if
he gets the chance. Note: Any damaged fossil cannot be reanimated.
* Obelisk - In a clearing near the villiage rises a black stone, twenty foot
monolith. Though weathered by time, precise geometric designs are clearly
visible. These designs are are disturbing to the eye and create a sense of
vertigo. Out of the corner of one's eye, they seem to swirl and pulse. If one
listens to the stone an almost impercetible rhythmic throbbing can be heard.
Crude stones are set up around the obelisk covered in primitive drawings of
spiders chasing and consuming tiny humans as shooting stars fall from the
heavens.
* Metamorphosis - On the night Cynthia is 'kidnapped', she goes directly to
the Obelisk. There the tribesmen have gathered to begin the ceremony. Near the
Obelisk are bound the 2 escaped killers that Major Nichols warned of as well
as any other captured males. Cynthia stands before the altar, removes her
clothes and sways to the Tcho Tcho songs. Eventually, she stops, bends over,
and the skin along her back splits wide open, revealing a shiny black surface
that pulses horribly. As the wrinkling empty skin of Cynthia Baxter is pushed
forward, multple legs spill out from the discarded molt, waving feebly, as the
huge spider-thing pushes clear. The priest dones Cynthia's discarded skin and
wears it like a coat.
* The Wedding Feast - Cynthia's new form is not hard enough to move freely
until dawn. In the meantime, she is ceremonially wedded to the male sacrifices
before she drags herself to each one and begins eating the flesh from the
victims head. She finally sucks the brains out through the eyesockets. Each
feast takes 20 minutes, and after each is consumed, the still animate corpses
with exposed skulls are freed and shamble mindlessly off into the forest. The
Onge people sense the threat of the Tcho Tcho and attack the Tcho Tcho. The
Tcho Tcho defend Cynthia and the priest as they escape. The Onge will not
pursue the Tcho Tcho into jungle at night. Instead the free any remaining
prisoners and wait for light. The priest makes his way to the prehistoric rock
and casts Child of Atlach-Nacha to animate the giant spider there.
* Daughter of Atlach-Nacha - At dawn, Cynthia is fully formed and begins a
3 hour trek across the island to the Caverns of Atlach-Nacha. She is
accompanied by hordes of spiders that crawl around and over her. Any who
follow will constantly be treading on spiders and have spiders dropping upon
them from the trees. Their bites are painful but are not dangerous.
* Caverns of Atlach-Nacha - Cynthia travels to a 20 foot cave opening where
her father dwells. If she is pursued, she will wait in ambush for her pursuers.
If the investigators are foolish enough to continue searching, they will
travel through twisting caverns deeper and deeper for over an hour before the
cave opens into a vast chasm nearly filled with thick, ropy webs. Continued
activity attracts [Atlach-Nacha] himself who resembles a hideous, black, hairy
spider with a strange, remotely human-like face with little red, hair-rimmed
eyes.")))

streets for Burgomaster Kranon. The Burgomaster is immediately recognizable
as Matthew, Julian Baxter's ward. In the Dreamlands, his emotional and mental
handicaps don't exist. If the investigators can get an audience, Krannon can
be convinced to help them, both here and in the real world.
* Cthaat Aquadingen - At the [Library at Ultar], the investigators can
search for the [Cthaat Aquadingen]. The book is bound in soft, human skin,
still pliable, and always moist from perspiration welling from its pores.
Simply handling the book is creepy. Within the book can be found a quote:
The stars fall, the beast bred of stone rampages, and a time of great change
comes. Deep within perfumed Kled, where life turns to death, the Watcher in
the Glade knows the time and place of the coming. Chinese notes are written
in the margin of the page. If they are translated, they comment that the
Pnankotic Manuscripts mentions the Watcher in the Glade.
* Pnakotic Manuscripts - If read, the manuscripts describe that the Watcher
in the Glade is the Great Old One Yibb-Tstil. Priests of Yibb-Tstil meet at
the great pool in front of the ivory palace. Priests then grovel on hands and
knees before Yibb-Tstil and must not look upon him.
priests of
* Carnival - While leaving Ultar, the dreamers chance upon a carnival tent. A
barker announces that they have the only captive Colossal purple spider from
the distant north. Admission is a dime or anything of value. The interior of
the tent is larger than the outside would suggest, and in a barred cage at
the back of the tent is a purple spider the size of a car hovering over the
dessicated body of a sheep. If anyone tries to talk to the spider, it speaks
in a thin, dry voice. It is, however, not helpful and eventually hisses. The
barker comes running in and ushers them out. If they want to speak more, the
barker says: 'It is not up to me you see'. The spider then says: 'After all, I
am the master here.' If the barker is questioned about the dwarf who works
here, he tells them the dwarf quit some time ago and headed to Kled.")

Enchanted Wood to Thran. At Thran a elephant caravan can be taken over land or
a river boat can be taken to Hlanith where passage on a ship can be found to
Kled.
* Numerous ivory palaces dot the jungles. If the dreamers ask about the great
pool mentioned in the Pnakotic Manuscripts, the guides recognize it as the
Palace of the Sacred Fount.
* Palace of the Sacred Fount - The palaces is one of the less feared locations,
though it is still avoided. As with other ivory palaces in Kled, the palace
is somehow physically in perfect condition though the rooms are empty and the
floors are thick with dirt and leaves. The smell in the area is a unique musky
odor that immediately reminds the dreamers of the smell during the dream of
the death of Phillip Baxter. The front hallway is an atrium where rain water
falls to collect in a rectangular pool. At the far end of the pool stands a
huge jade statue of an evil-looking hyena. The statue leers with gaping jaws
over the pool. The apparently bottomless pool is dark and filthly from rotting
leaves, a peculiar oily film covers its surface. Despite its appearance the
pool is not dangerous.
* Phillip's Ghost - A distant cackling sound can be heard. Following the
sound, the dreamers find a stairway going down many flights with torchlight
below. At the bottom of the stairs, the dreamers find a torchlit hallway with
a cell at the end. Within a cackling dwarf uses a human femur to visciously
beat a glowing, partially headless, staggering figure. The dwarf is hunched
and misshapen and has a terrible, inhuman face. Its lips are drawn into a
snarl over three-inch fangs. Its eyes are glowing red pits. The figure is
the dreamform of Phillip Baxter. If he is rescued, his headless form is
mindless and helpless. The dwarf with not help under any circumstances.
* Path to Yib-Tstll - Behind the Palace the jungle becomes stunted and
twisted, tree trunks are bent at odd angles, and a general sense of
disease pervades the growth. Futher on, alien foliage begins to appear
including quivering fungi and twisting weird ferns. Further still, a
great stone arch can be seen surrounded by dead trees. Through the arch
can be seen another alien jungle evidently on a far-off world. The arch
is clearly a permanent gate, and plants and insects can be seen crossing
both ways as if the arch were simple stone.
* World of Yib-Tstll - Beyond the arch, the sky is dark green and
starless. Swollen insects swoop ominously from deadly-looking blooms.
Flying horrors with veinous wings fly high above. Not far away, a vast,
black clearing is visible.
* The Clearing - The clearing is roughly a mile across. The black surface
is composed of fine flakes like snow, but it is warm to the touch. If the
dreamers heed the Pnakotic Manuscripts, they should crawl on hands and
knees across the black clearing facing the ground to avoid actually seeing
Yibb-Tstll. As the dreamers near the center, Yib-Tstll rises suddenly
from the black clearing. Dreamers may attempt to avert their gaze or
suffer the madness induced by his presence.
* [Yibb-Tstll] - The massive being speaks telepathically with a booming
alien voice. Each dreamer must make a [Spirit] test or Yibb-Tstll will
ignore that person completely. If the test is completely failed,
Yibb-Tstll will touch the person and impart its feared reversal.
Yibb-Tstll is suprisingly helpful and will answer questions about the
Cthulhu Mythos and things of cosmic import including Nemesis, but he will
only give a single answer on a subject and will not clarify himself.
* Reversals - Any dreamer who suffers a reversal will instantly be
driven insane or his human form or dream form will be permanently killed.
If an insane dreamer is brought to him, Yibb-Tstll will fully restore
his sanity. If the dwarf is present, Yibb-Tstll will reverse him, and his
dream form will change into the Tcho-Tcho priest while his real form will
become the dwarf. If the headless form and the ghoul's page are brought
before him, he touches them both and Phillip Baxter's dream fomr is
restored, but back in the real world, Silas Patterson has become a mad
imitation of Phillip Baxter.
* Web of Eibon - Yibb-Tstll instructed Eibon in his construction of the
Web of Eibon spell with which he planned to freeze time around Nemesis
(and Earth) to prevent Earth's destruction. Yibb-Tstll knows his efforts
will fail in the end, but it provided the instructions anyway.")

                       "* Ghoul Dream - After the events at St. Augustine and the Dreamlands, one
night the investigators find themselves having hazy dreams of the
graveyard at St. Augustine. Suddenly, the dream sharpens and 3 figures
start crawling from an open grave: ghouls like the ones that may have
been seen at St. Augustine. The ghouls stinking breath reeks of death and
decay. The ghouls do not appear to be hostile, instead they start urging
the investigators to come with them to see the wise man and there is
little time left before dawn. A terrific stench issues from the open
grave. Below rotten bits of wood and fabric lie on the grave floor and a
narrow, twisting tunnel leads into darkness. The ghouls gibber that they
must hurry and start climbing down the hole. If the dreamers don't follow
the tunnel begins to slowly close. If the dreamers still do not follow,
they awake normally, but the opportunity to learn more has been lost. If
they do follow, the tunnel collapses behind them and they will have to
follow the ghouls forward.
* Grath the Leader - Young and handsome by ghoul standards, Grath leads
the group and most often speaks with the dreamers. He had a riding zebra,
but the group got hungry and ate most of it.
* Mairpl the Big - Mairpl is much larger than the others, speaks little,
and wields a club in battle.
* Ug the Hungry - The worst and most degenerate of them, Ug speak no
human language and spends most of his time on four legs. He avoids the
humans, but can often be seen staring and drooling over them. He possess
no threat, but he likes to fantasize.
* The Page - At the end of the tunnel waits the Page. The Page is wrapped
in a dirty brown cloak with his face hidden. His body is bent forward
and staggers under the weight of an enormous tombstone chained to his
back. The ghouls order the Page around and play viscious practical jokes
on him. Below the hood can be found Sila Patterson's face, though it
shows no recognition. Upon the tombstone is written 'Phillip A. Baxter
1865-1925.' The Page is, of course, the dream form of Silas Patterson,
suffering from the guilt of the death of his friend.
* The Quest - The ghoul gang seeks to rescue a female ghoul Horella who
has disappeared. The ghouls are fairly melodramatic about how beautiful
she is and how they must rescue her from whatever peril she is in. To
find Horella, they seek the insight of the wise Man of the Mountain. This
man supposedly is very wise and will answer any questions.
* Social Ettiquette - After a few hours of travel, the ghouls stop for
nourishment. They squat down and rummage through their stained sacks.
They produce vaguely familiar cuts of raw meat with tinges of green along
with sour wine. The source of the meat is all too obvious. The ghouls
like their food well-aged and, out of respect, offer their guests the
oldest pieces. The bags also contain the remains of Grath's zebra which
the ghouls are more than happy to hand over, leaving the tastier pieces
for themselves.")

Underworld, the tunnel leads upward for 3 days through the center of a
huge mountain. Many ohter tunnels branch off, but the ghouls seem to know
their way. Drinking water oozes down the rock wall. Bloated fungi, pale,
foot-long crickets, and eyeless carnivorous rats server as food. Most of
the trip is in complete darkness. Occasionally, luminescent fungi provide
a tiny amount of light. The tunnels connect the Vaults of Zin where
dangerous ghasts, serpent folk, or worse may be encountered. Eventually,
the group exits the Underworld at the border of the [Stony Desert].
* [Stony Desert] - Grath says the journey eastward across the desert will
only take a few days. They seek the sacred mountain [Mt. Hatheg-Kla] where
a holy man can tell them where fair Horella can be found.
* Walker of the Stony Desert - A few days journey into the desert, the
dreamers see, off in the distance, a man leading a horse. They will meet
in about an hour. As they draw near, it is clear that the man is enormous,
towering over the horse. He is 8 feet tall, 400 lbs, and dressed all in
black. His horse seems old and tired and lags behind being pulled by a
rope. The horse is an elderly nag with cataract films covering both eyes.
The ghouls are terrified of the man and will not approach. He does not
stop walking unless he is attacked. This being is the dream-form of Eibon.
the Hyperborean wizard who, like the spell he cast to capture Eibon is
bound to travel back and forth across the Stony Desert. A legend says
that one day he shall find a way out of the desert. On that day, the
horse shall be healthy and the man shall then ride the horse. Where he
goes then, he does not know for the horse shall be the master. He freely
discusses his trip across the desert, Mythos knowledge, Nemesis, and his
spell the Web of Eibon that Yibb-Tstl taught him. He now knows that
stagnation is worse than destruction by Nemesis. If asked about Nemesis,
he produces a large, shining jewel from the air and offers it to the
dreamers. He says simply that all brave souls will know what to do when
the time comes. Any attempt to attack Eibon results in him disappearing
and reappearing far in the distance continuing his endless travels.")

more numerous. As they approach Mt. Hatheg-Kla, smoe of the slabs are
still turned upright in the ground and bear traces of ancient carvings.
Soon it becomes obvious that they are travelling in a titanic graveyard.
* Climbing Hatheg-Kla - Mairpl assures them that this is the only way to
see the holy man and ask where Horella is being kept. The other ghouls
will wait here while Mairpl and any brave dreamers attempt the climb.
The way up seems somewhat trecherous and will require a [Climb] roll to
succeed. If that roll fails, a second [Climb] roll must be made to catch
yourself before you fall to your doom. Unfortunately, Mairpl fails both
rolls and falls far below splattering on the rocks and potentially
injuring those below. After a short period of remorse, Grath and Ug
gather some of the larger pieces and add them to their provision bags.
* The Man on the Mountain - Near the skull tree, an old, bearded man in a
yellow robe sits on a heap of corpses plundered from the cemetary below.
He deftly uses a silver hatchet to cut pieces of the corpses and flings
the dripping gobbets above his head as the circling Byakhees swoop down
to catch them from the air. As the dreamers approach, the Byakhee scream
and chatter, but the man pays them no mind. If hailed, he smiles warmly,
and if asked questions he will honestly answer based on his vast
knowledge of the Dreamlands and the Mythos. Knowledge comes at a price,
so before he answers each question, he hurls his hatchet at the questioner
which instantly slices off an appendage, starting with a hand. The Byakhee
swoop down and eat the tidbit. The wound does not bleed and only hurts for
a moment. The damage is permanent in the Dreamlands, but each time a
dreamer returns to the Dreamlands one wound is healed. If asked, he tells
that Horella is at the castle of Bombel, the giant, in the hills to the
east of the [Stony Desert]. Anyone foolish enough to attach the man, is
attacked by the Byakhee, rended to pieces, and eaten.
* Cave of the Child God - Behind the tree, the shear face of Hatheg-Kla
rises another 1000 feet before the cave entrance. A flight of steps, each
one foot wide, criss-crosses back and forth up the slope. Anyone nearing
the opening hears a deep sobbing and suckling sound as if from some
enormous infant. The cave itself is completely black and no light will
penetrate it. If anyone enters, a few seconds later, horrifying screams
of agony echo from the cave accompanied by sucking, popping sounds and
a soft, cooing voice. The screams continue for almost a minute before
they are choked off by a gurgling, bubbling sound and a huge spray of
blood that shoots from the cave. The character's dream-self is dead, and
his waking self has been driven mad by the horrific dreamform of Nemesis.")

first sign of intruders, it rushes to the attack.
* Horella - Shortly after Bombel starts fighting, a foul-looking, scaly
ghoul appears in the window. This is Horella, and she immediately begins
hurling vile insults and rocks at the Gug. The ghouls are cheered on by
her presence, but if someone listens they realize that she is exhorting
Bombel to kill the intruders. Dreamers may also notice previous bruises
on Bombel's head. If Bombel falls, Horella turns her insults and rocks
at her would-be rescuers. Any remaining ghouls grab a chain from their
bags, say 'To the rescue', capture Horella, and drag her bumping down
the stairs. The ghouls bid farewell and will offer the page as a reward

                       "* Francis Wilson - Francis is one of the Tuesday Night Academy. He was at Phillip's funeral and he has been in Russia researching the Tunguska Blast and its possible relationship to Nemesis. He has made some discoveries and sends a telegram to Judge Braddock who forwards it along. The message says to leave immediately for Darjeeling, India and to meet Colonel Hugh Huntley of the British Foreign Office.
* Darjeeling -
* Colonel Hugh Huntley - Francis has arranged with the British Foreign Office to allow the investigators to travel to Lhasa, Tibet to aid him in his research. Colonel Huntley provides them with papers and can help arrange transport to the British Legation in Lhasa where Francis Wilson is staying.
* Road to Lhasa - The 400 mile journey to Lhasa can only be taken on foot or via horse-drawn caravan. The route is heavily trafficked by pilgrims, traders, smugglers, and spies. The journey takes weeks and is alternately terrifying, boring, facinating, cold, and misery-making.
* Lhasa - Lhasa is a sprawling squat city with no building taller than 2 stories except for the Potala, the home of the Dalai Lama. The Potala is a bulky, stone structure that is imposing but unattractive.
* The British Legation - The Legation is on the outskirts of Lhasa. Here Francis Wilson has residence. He seems thinner and more stressed than at the funeral. He has been researching the Tunguska Blast and mad Rasputin's apparent presence at the blast. After piecing together his research, he illegally entered the Soviet Union and stole parts of Rasputin's journal. He then fled to Tibet through Mongolia. He has been translating sections since then. He claims that Rasputin met someone called Eibon in his dreams, and that this Eibon told him of his own death. Eibon also warned him of a dark star that would fall from the sky. This Eibon gave him a stone that he used to destoy the star. He further foretells another dark star that would fall long after Rasputin's death in Tibet. Francis guesses that the location may be near an abandoned temple roughly 300 miles north of Lhasa. He has found a guide Lha-bzang who studied in the temple as a child.
* Lha-bzang - Francis plans to travel there soon with a native Tibetan, Lha-bzang. Lha-bzang is a domden, a Tibetan mortician. A skilled Anthropologist may recall that Tibetan funeral rites involve the corpse being hacked to bits by the axe-wielding domden and then fed to ravens or vultures. Lha-bzang's dream form is the holy man on the mountain. Lha-bzang is going on the journey to expand his spiritual understanding. Unfortunately, he has also been paid off by a Soviet spy. If questioned about the temple, he says he was sold as a slave as a child but he fled the temple when he realized that their teachings were not Buddhist.
* Ivan Dorkyev - A Soviet spy who has been tracking Francis down since Francis stole Rasputin's journal in Leningrad. He is over 6 feet tall and is dressed in the tattered robes of a yak-herder. Beneath, he carries two pistols, a knife, and a bandolier of ammo. He hides at his camp in the mountains near the ruins waiting for Lha-bzang to bring Francis.
* Trip to the Ruins - Lha-bzang leads the expedition 300 miles through a tangle of steep mountain passes, brackish lakes, and arid valleys. On the way, they encounter kay-herders, small mountain monasteries, and moutain farms. About 2 weeks in to the trip, while camped, a minor earth tremor shakes everyone awake. A week laker, they arrive at the Nenmka temple, sitting on the slope of a mountain.
* The Temple - The temple is now just a windswept ruin. A Mythos knowledge test reveals that the fallen columns have inscriptions used to invoke Hastur. The Soviet spy has watched the investigators approach and waits in hiding nearby. Lha-bzang finds a section of flooring with symbols on a tile. Here he will perform a ceremony to discover more about Nemesis.
* The Ceremony - Lha-bzang sits and lights a clay pipe containing a tarball of hashish. He passes the pipe around and then begins a droning wail. After 30 minutes, he retrieves a knife and a freshly severed human hand from his bag. He cuts his own palm, smears blood on the hand, and binds the cut. He then passes the knife to each person to do the same. If any will not, he gestures for them to leave the prayer circle. After another 5 minutes, the hand twitches and then turns toward Lha-bzang. He asks where can they find the Seed of Nemesis. The hand then crawls to a symbols on the ground indicating 'not far' and 'north-east'. Additional questions may be asked but each question causes the questioner to receive a minor Sanity Wound. Answers are always very short, and the hand only knows local events. The Soviet spy waits nearby but has accepted Lha-bzang's demand to allow the ceremony to complete before acting.
* Confrontation - Just as the ceremony is concluded, Ivan steps into the room brandishing his pistols and warning everyone to stay where they are. He is deadly serious and will gun down anyone who makes sudden movements. Ivan plans to take Francis back to the Soviet Union to stand trial for the many laws he has broken and suspiscion of being a spy. He has no knowledge of Nemesis and has nothing but contempt for the superstitious, religious ritual. If given the chance, he will tie up the investigators and then take Francis and Lha-bzang (his ally) in the morning.
* The Fallen Seed - In the early morning, everything changes. Along with the bright sun, a halo forms in the sky, though this halo does not surround anything visible, yet. Dorkyev is thunder-struck; he and Francis exchange words in Russian. Ever the pragmatist, Dorkyev frees everyone and begins a descent toward the valley under the halo. Within the valley, the halo light is flat and oily, and its color melts through shades of yellow and green as though through a prism. Lha-bzang vomits and flees. Suddenly, all present feel their hair stand on end as the halo darkens and takes on a dull gun-metal hue. The slight wind disappears and everything is silent. Then, high above a sizzling sound grows in intensity. Suddenly a hideous scream is heard followed by a thunderous blast that knocks everyone off their feet. Everyone suffer partial hearing loss and if a check versus [Body] is completely failed, the loss is permanent. A blinding light rips through the sky and crashes to Earth over the valley ridge that Lha-bzang crossed. A massive explosion rocks the ground and a curtain of flame passes overhead. If not for the ridge, everyone would have been incinerated along with Lha-bzang.
* Crater - Peeking over the ridge, a 20 foot crater can be seen with a sickly, green light emanating from it. Wilson frantically says that Eibon's symbol must be placed on the Seed or it will destroy the Earth. Those who have witnessed the Seed in Montana know that any who approach the Seed will die: quickly or slowly. If no one volunteers and no one has a plan, Dorkyev swears, snears of their cowardice, and takes the jewel to the crater. Alas, just as he climbs the crater and is exposed to the light, he screams and immediately melts into a puddle before everyone's horrified sight. Worse, he drops the jewel into the crater. If someone uses a mirror, they can see the jewel near the Seed which is slowly melting the rock around it with its terrible power. Wilson adamantly refuses to go (and will melt if pushed), so someone will have to sacrifice themself or watch the Seed sink into the ground and doom the world.
* Eye to Azathoh - The doomed person must resist the corrupting rays, retrieve the jewel, and then touch it to the Seed. Nothing happens for a few moments, then the Seed suddenly shimmers and disappers with a sharp pop. The Seed is gone but a black, marble tunnel lies in its place. The jewel lies on the ground before the tunnel. Hyperborean symbols line the tunnel. This is Eibon's work. When the jewel crosses the threshold, it suddenly reverts to the heavy glowing stone from the Dreamlands. There is a steady breeze down the tunnel and a light can be seen ahead. After 100 meters, a room 250 meter, circular opens up. The room is the exact same shape as the jewel. The breeze has become a howling gale ending in a 5 meter gateway in the center of the other end of the room. The gateway in the center of the oval room gives the impression of an eye looking out into space.
* Gateway - The gateway can be reached by a ramp that slopes upward 50 meters. Stars can clearly be seen through the opening, and it is clear that the gate leads directly into outer space. Anyone who has been exposed to the Seed radiance, has an intense desire to go through the gate and join Nemesis. Anyone approaching the gate will need ropes or climbing skill to cling to the reliefs on the floor or be sucked into oblivion. Also, the jewel gains weight as it approaches the gate, as if it is resisting, eventually becoming over 100lbs. If someone can get close or has binoculars, that person will see that the area of space beyond the portal is filled with criss-crossing black lines forming a faint web. Someone may recognize the black substance and The Black associated with Yibb-Tsll. This is Eibon's Web taught to him by Yibb-Tsll. Within the web, an observers intuitively senses that time is slowing to a crawl. Further, the web is creeping through the portal into our world. This is how mad Eibon hoped to save mankind, by freezing us forever in time, so Nemesis can never destroy us.
* The End - If the jewel is brought near the gate, in addition to its increased weight, the Black lines start to reach toward the jewel. Simply hurling the jewel through the portal will gather all the webs onto the jewel which breaks the spell of Eibon. If anyone returns to the Stony Desert, they will no longer find Eibon there. The world will no longer be trapped forever in frozen time, but Nemesis will still return some day to end the world, but it will not be today."))))

recently slain primate to gain extended life. This habit made him lose his job at
Brown when it was discovered that he was stealing monkey corpse from the lab. He has
since made an arrangement with a local undertaker with low moral character, Alvin
Beswick. Silas told Beswick that he was performing brain research, but Beswick is
just concerned with the money. Beswick allows him access to closed coffin corpses
for a price. He was given access to Phillip's corpse and noticed the small bite marks
on the scalp. While devouring the brain, Phillip suddenly lurched back to
consciousness and thrased wilding before dying. Silas was terrified and is wracked
with guilt over his friend's death. He is maintaining his sanity through denial, and
if he is forced to confront what he has done, he will retreat inward and become
catatonic and need to be institutionalized.
* Silas is friendly, but he not only knows his role in Phillip's death but is
reasonably sure that Cynthia was involved. He is planning to return to the Andaman
Islands to investigate Cynthia's activities and also because it is getting hard to
hide his youth in Providence.
* In Sila's desk can be found notes for his next book, about cannibalism. The notes
indicate that Silas is unbalanaced. In his files can be found the lease to a
farmhouse.
* Investigating the farmhouse, leads to the table where Phillip met his end. No
attempt has been mde to cover up the crime.")))))))

               "* Strengths:
** Agility and endurance: In some scenes, they were able to bring down a full-size horse and nearly match the speed of one for short, sustained periods of time.
** Short incubation period: It takes about 15 seconds to 1 minute for a victim to turn into an undead zombie. Making them effectively at multiplying and overwhelming urban centres. However, this can vary. One main character was able to resist the infection for over 2 minutes.
** Durability: It has been observed that even if their internal organs are exposed or took a direct stab from a sword to their chest, this doesn't kill them.
** Heightened sense of smell: A fresh drop of blood from an uninfected human can attract other infected bodies many meters away.
* Weakness:
** Decapitation: They're capable of taking damage that would be fatal to most men. It was found that decapitation or destruction of the head is the most effective in killing them.
** Aversion to water bodies: It has been observed they will generally avoid travelling on water bodies. They have no ability to swim, and when they are pushed into deeper waters, they will immediately sink to the bottom.
** Heat: They have been observed to immediately seek shelter when the day begins to break in order to escape the heat of direct sunlight. As a result, during spring or summer, they are only active during the day and hibernate at night.
** Fire: Fire can be used to keep infected at bay.
** Reduced vision: The milky eyes limits their vision to basic movements, so they rely on smell and hearing to hunt.
** Blood: Blood can be used to distract or bait the zombies to behave in certain ways. Although dangerous, using fresh blood on rooftops is shown to be an effective means to lure zombies if needed."))
