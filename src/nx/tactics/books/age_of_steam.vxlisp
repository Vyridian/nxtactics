       "Round 1 - Turn 1
Initiative
Gunslinger player starts with the initiative, but the Marshall wants to 'Take the Initiative'
Each Player rolls 2 dice.
+1 for the player who currently holds initiative.
+1 for highest skill.
-1 if most Damaged or Stunned.
A tie means simultaneous actions.
Gunslinger rolls 6 + 1 (holds initiative) = 7.
Marshall rolls 8.  Marshall takes the initiative.
Move
Marshall is within range of his weapon, so chooses not to move to get the best chance to hit.
Action
Fast Draw - Marshall is in weapon range and chooses to use Fast Draw to draw his weapon and fire.
Attack - Fast Draw was a Free Action and Marshall chooses to fire.  He uses his Handgun Skill and any modifiers to determine attack dice.  5 (Handguns) +1 (Accuracy) - 1 (Hip Shoot) = 6 Dice
Marshall rolls 6 dice and gets 1 (miss), 2 (miss), 2 (miss), 3 (miss), 5 (hit), and 6 (hit and bonus die).  He rolls the bonus die and gets another 6 (critical hit and bonus die).  He rolls the bonus die and gets a 3 (flag).
Marshall's total roll is 1 hit, 1 critical, and a flag.
Defense
Gunslinger now rolls dice equal to appropriate defense:  4 Body = 4 Dice
Gunslinger rolls 3 dice and gets 1 (miss), 3 (miss), 5 (hit), and 6 (hit and bonus die).  He rolls the bonus die and gets a 4 (critical hit).
Gunslinger's  total is 2 hits and 1 critical.
Gunslinger's 1 hit cancels one of  Marshall's hits and his 1 critical hit cancels one of Marshall's critical hits.  This leaves Marshall with only a single flag,  Gunslinger had rolled a second hit, but since it can only cancel other hits, it has no effect.
Effects
Flags - Gunslinger gains a Flag Token and must retreat one space for each flag.  He therefore retreats 1 space away from Marshall.
Attack Damage - Since no damage was rolled, Marshall's turn is over.
Round 1 - Turn 2
Initiative
Gunslinger player regains the initiative.  Marshall has already taken a turn and cannot do so again this round.
White Tokens - After initiative is determined, Gunslinger must remove a White Token if any.  He removes the Flag token.
Move
Gunslinger was forced to back by the Flag but is still in his weapon's range, so he will not take an attack penalty.  However, if he moves closer he will take a penalty for moving, so he opts to stay still and fire.
Action
Fast Draw - Gunslinger also uses Fast Draw to draw and fire.
Attack - He uses his Handgun Skill and any modifiers to determine attack dice.  5 (Handguns) +1 (Accuracy)  -1 (Hip Shoot) = 5 Dice.
Gunslinger rolls 5 dice and gets 1 (miss), 3 (miss), 4 (hit), 5 (hit), and 5 (hit).  His total roll is 3 hits.  Nice.
Defense
Marshall now rolls dice equal to appropriate defense.  4 Body = 4 Dice.
Marshall rolls 4 dice and gets 1 (miss), 1 (miss), 3 (miss), and 4 (hit).
Marshall's total is 1 hit.
Marshall cancels 1 of Gunslinger's hits.  This leaves Gunslinger with 2 hits.
Effects
Damage Rating - Since Gunslinger rolled at least 1 hit or critical hit (he scored 2), he checks the damage rating of his Schofield .45.  Its damage rating is 4.  If Gunslinger had rolled less than 4 dice, the Schofield would allow him to roll the difference in additional damage dice.  However, Gunslinger rolled 4 dice already, so he receives no additional dice.
Hits - The first hit is converted to a Stun Token.
Damage - All subsequent hits are converted to Damage Tokens.
Damage Summary - 1 Stun Token and 1 Damage Token.
Hit Location - Since we are using Hit Location and did some form of damage, roll 2 dice.  The first determines side of the body: 1-2 is left side, 3-4 is center, and 5-6 is right side.  The second die determines height on the body: 1-2 is low, 3-4 is middle, 5-6 is high.  Marshall rolls 6 (right), 2 (low): Right Shin/Foot.  The 1 Damage Token is therefore on Marshall's Right Shin.  This will limit his movement.
Turn End
Round End - Since all units have acted, the round ends.
Round 2 - Turn 1
Initiative
Marshall has the initiative since Gunslinger player ended with the initiative, but Gunslinger predictably wants to 'Take the Initiative' back.  Marshall desperately needs to win initiative to recover a bit from the last hit.
Each Player rolls 2 dice.
+1 for the player who currently holds initiative.
+1 for highest skill.
-1 if most Damaged or Stunned.
A tie means simultaneous actions.
Marshall rolls 4 + 1 (holds initiative) -1 (most Damaged) = 4.
Gunslinger rolls 8 and takes the initiative.  Gunslinger grins.
White Tokens - Gunslinger has no White Tokens.
Move
Gunslinger presses his advantage and stays and fires hoping to finish this battle.
Action
Since their guns are already drawn, neither unit needs to fire from the hip anymore.
Attack - Gunslinger determines attack dice.  5 (Handguns) +1 (Accuracy)  = 6 Dice.
Gunslinger rolls 6 dice and gets 1 (miss), 1 (miss), 3 (miss), 5 (hit), 5 (hit), and 6 (hit and bonus die).  He rolls the bonus and gets 1 (flag).  His total roll is 3 hits and a flag.  Looking good.
Defense
Marshall now rolls dice equal to appropriate defense.  4 Body -1 (Damage) -1 (Stun) = 2 Dice.  Need some good rolls about now.
Marshall rolls 2 dice and gets 1 (miss) and 1 (miss).  Nothing.
Marshall is hit dead-on by the Gunslinger.
Effects
Damage Rating - Since Gunslinger rolled at least 1 hit or critical hit (he scored 3), he checks the damage rating of his Schofield .45.  Its damage rating is 4 is not more than his 6 dice rolled so no additional dice.
Hits - The first hit is converted to a Stun Token.
Damage - All subsequent hits are converted to Damage Tokens.
Damage Summary - 1 Stun Token and 2 Damage Tokens.
Hit Location - Since we are using Hit Location and did some form of damage, roll 2 dice.  The first determines side of the body: 1-2 is left side, 3-4 is center, and 5-6 is right side.  The second die determines height on the body: 1-2 is low, 3-4 is middle, 5-6 is high.  Marshall rolls 2 (left), 4 (center): Left Thigh.  The 2 Damage Tokens are therefore on Marshall's Left Thigh.  This will limit his movement even more.
Damage Total - 2 Stun Tokens and 3 Damage Tokens (1 on Right Shin, 2 on Left Thigh).  The total of -5 is greater than the Marshall's 4 Body, so he drops to the ground.
Round 2 - Turn 2
Initiative
Marshall has the initiative since Gunslinger has already acted this round.
White Tokens - Marshall removes a  White Token if any.  He removes 1 of the Stun tokens.
Move
Marshall is prone and has no Move left to even crawl (Move 4 - 1 (Stun) - 3 (Damage)).
Action
Marshall could attack with 5 (Handguns) + 1 (Accuracy) - 1 (Stun) - 3 (Damage) = 2 Dice, but he has no dice to defend next turn, he is Prone (+1) and Helpless (+1) for a total of 8 Gunslinger Dice against his own 0 Dice.  What's more the gunslinger doesn't have a scratch on him.
The duel is clearly over, and the Marshall drops his gun and begs for his life."))))
