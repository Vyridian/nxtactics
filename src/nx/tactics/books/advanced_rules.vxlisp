      :summary "The Tactics:Basic Rules are sufficient for running a board game, but they lack detail when simulating a specific genre. The Tactics system is designed to allow different sets of rules to be plugged into the basic rules on an ala carte basis. This Advanced Rule book provides many of the optional rules necessary to increase realism or pseudo-realism. The other genre-based rule books will add rules that are specific to each genre.")

       "* Strike First - Units are immediately penalized for damage taken, so do unto others before they do unto you.
        * Maintain a Threat - The battlefield changes with each unit's move, so use pawns to control the map while saving powerful and valuable units until later in the Round.  If you are not careful your opponent will surround and eliminate your units that have already acted.
        * Hold the Line - Opportunity and Hold Off abilities are deadly and allow you to protect weaker units.
        * Use the Terrain - Cover and abilities linked to cover offer an outstanding defense that layers with normal defense. The difference is most pronounced with lesser units. Effective use of terrain will determine the victor in most battles."))))

       "Carrier Command is a set of rules for use with units that hold other units in a [Hanger].

       Common Actions
       * Enter or Exit Hanger - Move and Action (Unit): Place a unit from the [Hanger] on the [Flight Deck] OR from the [Flight Deck] to the [Hanger].
       Only 1 unit may be on the [Flight Deck] at any given moment and may be targetted normally there.
       * Launch or Land - Move and Action (Unit): Move a unit onto or off of the [Flight Deck].  If the carrier has a [Launch Catapult], a launching
       unit gains +2 movement.
       * Dive Bomb - Action: -4 Altitude and drop bombs attacking the top of the target creating [Fire] and damaging weapons, crew, and [Flight Deck].
       Normally only the target and opposing aircraft can [Interrupt] before the bombs are dropped.  Can only be performed from exactly +5 Altitude
       and with no [White Tokens].
       * Torpedo Bomb - Action: Drop torpedo attacking a side of the target below the water line creating [Flooding] and damaging [Speed].  Can only be
       performed from exactly +1 Altitude and with no [White Tokens].
       * Landing - Move and Action (Unit): Move a unit and place it on the [Flight Deck].  Only 1 unit may be on the [Flight Deck] at any given moment
       and may be targetted normally there.
       * Refuel or Reload - Move and Action (Unit): Any unit on the [Flight Deck] or in the [Hanger] may refuel OR reload weapons (changing weapons if
       desired).")
