               "* The process of working with the prima materia to create the philosopher's stone. It has been used to describe personal and spiritual transmutation.
* Prima Materia - The ubiquitous starting material required for the magnum opus. It is the primitive formless base of all matter similar to chaos, the quintessence or aether.
* Process philosophy - An approach to philosophy that identifies processes, changes, or shifting relationships as the only true elements of the ordinary, everyday real world. It treats other real elements (examples: enduring physical objects, thoughts) as abstractions from, or dependents on, processes.
* Stages of the Magnum Opus
** Nigredo - The blackening or melanosis means putrefaction or decomposition. After gathering the Prima Materia, the material and the Alchemist must undergo putrefactio. The material is processed until it turns completely black. This is by far the longest and most difficult stage. It is often known as the 'dark night of the soul.' We are being asked to let go of all within us and outside of us that is not in full alignment with the truth of who we are. This is a truth as it exists on a soul level, far beyond the ego and its limited ideas or illusions about who we 'should' be. It is made far more difficult by the resistance and defenses we put up against it. Many of us will resist for years, remaining unwilling to accept that our lives, as we know them, are over. Few of us are quick to grasp the fact that there is new life waiting for us if we would only let go of the limited vision of existence we usually try so desperately to cling to. It is only when we become willing to surrender that the alchemical process truly begins. Only when we are willing to die do we have the chance to one day be reborn.
** Albedo - The whitening or leucosis is the perfect purification. The material is further processed removing all blackness until only pure white remains. Then it is said that life has conquered death, that the king has been revived. When one has purified his awareness of Self, during meditation, by eliminating thoughts, or otherwise, then at a certain point, light appears. The light that appears is also metaphoric for an absolute clear, pure awareness of Self. In that state one is in a very fixed position, that is, very stable, very much in the here and now, in total clarity of Self. In Whiteness, the material has attained a degree of Fixedness that fire cannot destroy.
** Rubedo - The reddening, purpling, or iosis. When the White stone or the White Elixir has been made, it needs to purified further, sublimated, until the material becomes totally Fixed and is completely stable. Then we have the Red Sulfur, the red stone, the Red Elixir, the Stone of the Wise. When the divine light has emerged during meditation, one needs to make it last. this demands a continued effort of holding one's attention to this pure awareness, not only for the length of the meditation session, but also during every day life. At a certain point the pure awareness of one's divine self will be permanent."

The level of the ability determines the number of years in the past from which the wound is erased. If the entire history is erased the wound will have never occurred and no one will remember it except the caster. The person's life history is rewritten without the wound. This can result in significant changes if the wound was debilitating. The power of this ability ensures that any changes will never be worse than the current situation.")

An item is perfectly visualized and then drawn into reality from the Astral Realm. Conjuration is similar to [Illusion], but its creations are real though they are rarely permanent.
* Action: Check Skill vs. the Value of the item to create. If successful, the item can be used a number of times equal to the result before disintegrating. If the user has a specialty with an item, that specialty may be applied to the check.
* Benefits - Conjuration is the natural ability of the Astral Realm and Dream Realm. All abilities are +1 in these Realms.
* Limitations - Creation magic is exceedingly difficult with only relatively minor creations possible. The process of Conjuration is different from natural things, so all Conjured things have some imperfection or mark that distinquishes itself from a natural thing.
* Concidental - Conjuring in ways that appear like the object was already there is [Coincidental Magic]. E.g. Drawing an illusionary sword from a real scabbard."

           "* Sympathetic magic is using a symbol to represent the thing you want to affect with your magic. Whatever you do to the symbol, you do to the target. The object and the thing it represents are 'in sympathy'; they are aligned. Sympathetic magic is a useful idea because often, your target is something non-physical, or something you can’t otherwise interact with directly. You could banish negative thoughts directly, but it’s easier to tie them to something physical by writing them down and then burning the paper. As the paper burns, so does the negativity. Correspondences are related to this. For example, different-colored candles represent different desires (like green for money, red for love, black for banishment, etc.) and as the candle burns down, your spell is cast. Wearing different stones or crystals can attract luck or success to you.   
				* Cursed Energy - Cursed energy is born from negative emotions such as grief and anger. These negative feelings are common in human society so almost everyone possesses cursed energy. Cursed Energy can be controlled and focused to perform various magical feats.
				* Cursed Spirit - Cursed Spirits are apparitions manifested entirely from cursed energy. Even their bodies are composed of cursed energy, making cursed spirits invisible to non-sorcerers. The emission of cursed energy from humans collects like sediment until a cursed spirit is born from the collective negative energy. Cursed Spirits born with strong feelings directed toward a certain aspect are especially strong. The stronger humanity's fear and anger is directed at cursing a certain aspect of the world, like natural disasters, the more powerful Curse Spirits spawned from those negative sentiments will be.
				* Law of Similarity - Like produces like. An effect resembles its cause.
				* Law of Contact/Contagion - Things which have once been in contact with each other continue to act on each other at a distance."
