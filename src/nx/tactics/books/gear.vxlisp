The Valknut pendant is used by those who swear allegiance to Odin in both life and death and want to fight alongside the gods during Ragnarok. When a valknut is found, Odin is also near. This is true for engravings of the valknut as well as for those who decide to wear Odin’s symbol.
            * Description - Valknut literally translates into 'the knot of the fallen warriors.' This symbol is also strongly connected to the deceased as is apparent in its linguistic meaning. The symbol itself represents the 9 worlds of existence. It is created through the fierce binding of three triangles. The Valknut also has the power over both life and death, as it weaves both into a knot."

            diamond's is higher), whitest color, and the highest optical reflectivity.
            * Jewellery and silverware are traditionally made from Sterling silver (Standard silver) an
            alloy of 92.5 % silver with 7.5% copper.  Sterling silver is harder than pure silver,
            and has a lower melting point.

            as disinfectants.  Silver-ions and silver compounds show a toxic effect on some
            bacteria, viruses, algae and fungi.  Its germicidal effects make silver utensils valued,

            troy pound of sterling silver.
            * The words for 'silver' and 'money' are the same in at least 14 languages.
            * Hippocrates, the father of modern medicine, wrote that silver had beneficial healing
            and anti-disease properties, and the Phoenicians used to store water, wine, and vinegar
            in silver bottles to prevent spoiling.  In the early 1900s people would put silver
            dollars in milk bottles to prolong the milk's freshness.

            polished silver, and as such, vampires allegedly cannot be seen in them because they
