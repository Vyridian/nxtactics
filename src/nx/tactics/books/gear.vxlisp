This is true for engravings of the valknut as well as for those who decide to wear Odin’s symbol.
            * Description - Valknut literally translates into 'the knot of the fallen warriors.' This symbol is also strongly connected to the deceased as is apparent in its linguistic meaning. The symbol itself represents the 9 worlds of existence. It is created through the fierce binding of three triangles. The Valknut also has the power over both life and death, as it weaves both into a knot."
