      :summary
       "* A near future Earth where all activity is monitored by cameras and microphones placed everywhere including bedrooms, bathrooms, and sewers. They cover multiple angles and are nearly impossible to avoid. Computers monitor the feeds and immediately report any criminal activity to police. The police arrest the criminal, conviction is swift, and the criminal is psychologically or chemically 'reconditioned' against further crimes and returned to society. Crime is basically non-existent, and no one remembers a time before the monitoring 	was established. Police are friendly and do not appear in uniform unless a crime has been committed. Police only carry non-lethal weapons unless they are known to be facing armed resistance.
* Any outsiders entering this world will have a hard time avoiding criminal activity. Fortunately, the computers are unconcerned with suspicious activity and only notice actual crimes. However, attempts to disable cameras are crimes themselves.
* Interrogations and reconditioning are all computer controlled. Using sophiticated lie detectors, drugs, and aversion therapy, the patient can usually be reconditioned and returned to society in a matter of weeks.
* A small resistance exists, but there is little they can achieve without outside help. The question is: should they be helped?")

       "* A temporal paradox has trapped the entire Earth in a time loop. For about a month, the people of the planet relive the same week over and over. They remember each loop but the longer they stay in the loop the more likely they are to be compelled to repeat the same events each time. Those who suffer or die during the period know they will repeat their actions but are largely powerless to stop themselves. The experience would eventually drive them insane if their minds could change that much.
* Time travelers who arrive are immediately recognized by everyone as being different from the previous events. The locals are tremendously thankful that they can react differently since the travelers weren't in the previous time loops. This will be short lived, however, because once the loop resets the time travelers will be part of the loop, and each time the loop resets it will become harder for everyone to act differently again. If the travelers don't sort out this problem, they will be trapped here forever."))))

The Predators often ritualistically mutilate their prey and usually claim a trophy from their kills. Capable of interstellar travel in star ships, the Predators have hunted on Earth for centuries and have also had prior contact with the Engineers.
* Aside from their repeated conflicts with humans, the Predators have notably been associated with Xenomorph XX121, known to them as kiande amedha ('hard meat'), whom they revere as perhaps the most worthy of all prey.

Backing up these weapons are two Neutral Particle Beam cannons. These large weapons are mounted along the main hull, and can only fire in a forward arc. Although they do not provide the ship with a Hard Kill capability, they can be used to disrupt a enemies electronics at huge ranges. For close range weapons there are two laser cannons located on either side of the ship. These cannons provide close in defense against missiles, mines, and the odd fighter. For some additional close in Hard Kill capabilities there are two rail guns on the ship, one on top, and the other on the bottom of the main hull. Firing a combination of both kinetic penetrators (essentially tungsten darts) which can punch holes through almost any armor, and kinetic penetrator incendiary (tungsten tipped darts designed to vaporize AFTER impact), these weapons have a reasonable rate of fire, and can do quite a lot of damage to other ships.
* The ship is also capable of laying mines, with sixty mines available in a ventral dispenser. Although not as large a threat to enemy ships as the ships missiles, they are still quite effective for interdiction and for cutting off civilian shipping.
* For orbital bombardment the ship has a ventral launcher filled with eighty re-entry vehicles. These can carry a variety of warheads, including nuclear payloads. Such ordnance can only be used when the ship receives the orders to do so from its Captain, or from a Marine Major or personnel higher in rank than that.")))

    "Azuriach Empire"
     (section
      :name "Azuriach Empire"
      :summary
       "History:
        * Exodus - After the first Exodus to space, the over-industrialized, pollution ridden Earth fell into a deep recession. The remaining population of Earth began to feel that their fellow humans had abandoned them to their fate and grew to resent their spacefaring kin.
        * Eugenics War - After the Eugenics War, Earth banned all genetic engineering including cloning and artificial life while the Colonials embraced these technologies for their very survival.  Earth began to see the Colonials as a twisted offshoot of mankind that chose a sterile life in space surrounded by runaway technology instead of a wholesome life with earth, sky, and sea.
        * Azure Party - After the Eugenics War, the Earth moved toward a 'Pure Earth' platform combining a resurgence of religion with a return to a more natural, peaceful way of life, on Earth.  A particularly militaristic wing of the the 'Pure Earth' movement became known as the Azure party due to the round blue patches they wore symbolizing the Earth. The Azures were experts at propaganda and found an easy scapecoat in the Colonials.  As the global recession continued, the Azures influence over Earth politics increased.
        * United Earth Alliance (UEA) - After millenia of conflict, Earth united under a single banner, the United Earth Alliance (UEA). Its political platform was the 'Pure Earth' platform, without genetic engineering, without cloning, and with the UEA in control of the Solar System. The Colonials saw this for the power grab that it was and mocked this position as the 'Groundhog Movement'.
        * Solar Cold War - The UEA and the Colonials, especially the Jovians, fought a cold war for decades trying to gain the upper hand. The development of Exo-suits by the Jovian Confederation led to a new arms race between the Jovians and Earth. In the end, the strain on the Earth economy was too great, and the UEA became desparate. In order to maintain control, they declared martial law and began a military build up. This ultimately, forced the other Colonials to rally toward the Jovians or lose their sovereignty.
        * The Rock War - Earth's military might far exceeded the colonies, but their reach was limited to Earth's orbit. The Colonials had far more spaceships, but the vast majority of these were civilian ships.  Ultimately, however, it was the UEA's unpopularity that was its downfall. Before the final battle, sabotage and poor maintenance had incapacitated half of the Earth fleet. When the final battle was fought, the Colonials used their superior numbers to engage the Earth fleet in high Earth orbit where Earth's gravity well restricted the UEA fleet's movements. Then the Colonials covertly captured the industrial Mass Drivers on the Moon and began railing rocks into the Earth fleet and unto Earth itself. After horrific loses on both sides, the Earth military staged a coup on Earth and immediately negotiated a cease fire. The UEA was disbanded and their leaders (largely Azures) were put on trial.
        * Terran Union - After the fall of the UEG, the Colonials created a new representative goverment with each colony, including Earth and Luna, as a state. Earth began rebuilding, but the scars of the war would take centuries to heal.
        * Colony Ships - After 50 years of peace, the colonization of the Solar System was moving along smoothly, so the Terrans began to look outward to the stars. New discoveries in propulsion made long-range probes and colony ships feasible, though their journeys were still measured in decades, so they would still be one-way missions.
        * First Contact - The Terrans had been searching the stars for extra-terrestrial life for hundreds of years, but they were not prepared to find it in their own backyard. A survey of Pluto uncovered an abandoned alien outpost. This was the Terrans' first proof of alien life, and it was decidedly malevolent. This refocused space exploration on the construction of military warships. 30 years later, a human colony vessel had its first face-to-face encounter with a space-faring, alien race, the Thranx.
        * Alliance - The Thranx were much more advanced than the Terrans, but fortunately they were also much more peaceful. The Thranx were part of a loose trade Alliance of races including the Blarads, Caitians, Saurians, and Vargr. The Terrans entered the Alliance and were able to purchase the secrets to FTL drives.  With FTL, colonization of the stars began in earnest. Like the early American settlers, there were many willing to risk death for a chance at a new life. Large colony ships began radiating outward to nearby planets.  Among these were a number of disgruntled Azures who were horrified at the sight of humans reduced to a third rate state in an alien dominated Alliance. Over the next decades, the Azures began settling in one region of stars distant from any alien races.
        * Azuriach Imperium - Over time, the Azures consolidated power in their sector of space. They secretly built a large military fleet, and by the time the Terran Union discovered them, the Azures were powerful enough to declare themselves the Azuriach Imperium. Officially, the larger Alliance considers the Azuriachs a human internal problem. Unofficially, the Alliance is concerned with the distinctly human-centric views of the Azuriachs and are not interested in the Azuriachs gaining power over the human worlds."

The salamanders live in costal cities made of coral outcroppings (reefs) and carry on all industry in environmentally safe factories and other facilities.

That which they cannot trade for, they take.
* The Aeodronians have become scavengers and pillagers of the galaxy. They abhor the Alliance's method of colonial exploitation, and the salamanders are bitter enemies of its military. There is some hypocrisy in this statement, because salamander's are known to pillage and plunder Alliance worlds.

extremely fast and can able to achieve speeds of 40mph for short periods of time.
Despite their size, they are strong climbers and swimmers. When necessary, they can
walk erect, but they are clumsy on two feet. They possess excellent hearing and
vision especially at night. They possess prehensile paws, with retractable fingers
but have limited manual dexitery. They are stealthy stalkers and are adept at
scouting, hunting, and ambushing.
* Combat - Their melee prowess is legendary, but their paws make ranged weapons
awkward, so instead they tend to mount smart weapons on their backs. They are also
sometimes willing to allow small creatures (like Mazians) to ride on their backs.
Cizerack culturally prefer close combat to cowardly ranged weapons, but they are
gradually overcoming this predjudice.
* History - The Cizerack evolved on a world with a few continents dominated by
grassy plains and scrubland. Winters are harsh, and most animals including the
Cizerack burrow into the ground and hibernate during the winter. There is a polar
variant of the Cizerack that is adapted to the cold weather and does not usually
hibernate. The Cizerack have long been at the top of the food chain, and have a long
cultural history. They only recently developed technology in an effort to solve their
over-population problem."

       "* Description - The Chatilians are from the planet Chatil in the Fomalhaut star
system. They are frail, delicate looking, greenish blue plant beings with thin
bodies and large, bullet-shaped heads. Chatilians are herbivores. They have no real
mouth, rather they possess facial slits through which they strain their food intake.
Their arms and legs are like branches and roots which must be pruned to grow into
useful limbs. When angered, Chatilians whine loudly, bug out their eyes, and drool
yellow spit from their facial slits. This would be somewhat comical, except this is a
sign that they are generating and then people start dying.
* Telepathy - They can speak aloud with great difficulty, though they do not normally
need to because their skulls are crowned with sensory nodes which allows them
communicate telepathically among themselves. With focus, an empath also may read an
unprotected mind in close proximity.
* Psykokinesis - Although Empaths are innocuous looking, they are actually among the
more dangerous and formidable opponents in the galaxy. Through the evolutionary
process, they have developed psycho-kinetic power which allows them to harness and
transmit psychic energy. This unusual ability is called Generating. Empaths employ
psychic and illusionary attack forms. Advanced Chatilians can actually crush the
minds of their enemies.
* Personality - They are generally considered rude, peculiar, and annoying by other
races. They are not overly fond of other races either. They intensely dislike any
inconvenience including bad weather. A large part of their scientific development has
been toward atmospheric control and terraforming. Chatilians like water but hate any
kind of physical exertion. They are sensitive to everything, so noise, bright lights,
gaudy art, hot weather, cold weather, dumb people, etc, etc. all irriate the sedate
intellectuals to no end.
* Colonies - Chatilian buildings are strange tiered affairs with rooms and floors of
different sizes, terraces and skylights everywhere, and stark blank surfaces. The
architecture is similar to adobe cities and Mediterraean beach communities. Chatilian
cities are sprawling low-lying residential areas with all industry and commerical
operations underground. Trees and plants are allowed to grow naturally throughout the
cities. The underground is a maze of indirect passages and oddly shaped rooms.
Tourist often get lost which the Chatilians attribute to their limited mental
capacity.
* History - The Chatilians homeworld is closer to its star than Earth. It is hot and
humid year round, and its 4 moons reflect much light even at night. In this world,
mobile plant life evolved instead of animal life. Though all Chatilians speak
telepathically, the ability to generate only occurs in 1% of the populace. The ability or inability to generate has created 2
classes and numerous, bloody civil wars with one side or the other taking control.
The current royal family can generate and their power is buffered by a representative
parliament. This arrangement has lasted for 500 years, but there always remains a
risk of civil war."

        * History - The Eridani have a long history of conflict and conquest among themselves before uniting to bring their conquests to the stars. They are not interested in statecraft, so conquered worlds were largely left to their own devices besides helping pay for the eternal war effort. Eventually, they encountered a trecherous enemy in the Phentari squids. This enemy was able to lure the Eridani fleet into an all out attack while launching a covert attack against the Eridani homeworld reducing it to rubble. The Eridani empire was shattered and they can never live down the humiliating defeat. They now maintain a blood feud with all Phentari."

    :Mazian
     (section
      :name "Mazian"
      :summary
       "* The Mazian is an amorphous being, able to change shape to resemble other objects. It is normally a gel-like amorphous being, each cell existing as a separate entity and yet working in a harmonious symbiotic relation with the other cells around it. The Mazian has no central nervous system, rather the outer layer of skin is covered with small nodes that allow the Mazian to sense ground vibrations. The nodes also make Mazians vulnerable to loud noises and sonics. It is an asexual being that reproduces through budding every ten years. It eats by absorbing liquids into its body and the Mazian can absorb small objects for temporary storage.
        * Personality - Mazians are very friendly creatures with no sense of personal space. They hang around in huge piles and are only truly happy when touching something or someone. As a colony creature, Mazians lack a sense of individuality. They do not understand personal property or war as they believe in sharing everything. Many other races find this perspective to be naive. The tactile nature of the Mazians combined with their selfless nature make them very popular companions and lovers. They have formed a close bond with the Cizerak despite the fact that their races have only recently encountered one another. Cizeraks have been known to carry Mazian companions on their backs.
        * Movement - Mazians normally travel low to the ground, sliding rapidly over surfaces.They are also fully amphibious and move gracefully like an eel or a squid. Mazians can also burrow through loose earth and can slide through narrow tunnels and pipes with no feeling of claustrophobia.
        * Communication - Mazians normally communicate by touch but may also make coded thumping noises through the ground or grunting noises in the water. To speak with other races, they use voice synthesizers.
        * Senses - Mazians cannot see, but have evolved a complex form of sonar which allows them to distinguish shapes. They have a fantastic sense of smell, able to detect residual odors better than a bloodhound. Their sense of taste is so good that they can use it to distinguish the dyes used in different colors and can use this ability to read by touch. Mazians have developed an ocular device that they can use to see as other creatures do.
        * Replication - The Mazian's ability to change it's form makes it the ultimate espionage/infiltration specialist. As the Mazian learns to control the cell metamorphoses, its chance to accurately duplicate something increases. At high levels, a Mazian can replicate a humanoid form. When attempting to replicate, the Mazian flows over an object, internally records the physical matrix, then copies it. Mazians often pay handsome amounts of money for internal skeletons to aid them in replicating bipedal and quadrapedal forms.
        * Weaknesses - Mazians jelly-like form is sensitive to sonics and dessicants. They are vulnerable to the drying effects of heat and cold, but their predominatly liquid form does not catch fire easily."

       "* The Mutzachan Energy Controller is one of the most powerful of all the known races. They can manipulate energy through their body to generate tremendous, destructive power. Mutzachan love the power of raw energy. They feel that energy must fill its potential and dislike the storage of energy.
        * Description - Mutzachans are indigenous to the planet Trishmag of the Cygni-A star system. They are small, bipedal humanoids, with large heads and large pale green eyes. They are by far the most intellectually advanced race in the known galaxies. Their brains have almost twice the convoluted surface area of human brains.
        * Physiology - Their high intellect and technology have left them with a distain for physical labor and consequently their physiological has suffered leaving them physically weak and easily tired. Their constitution is also weak leaving them unusally vulnerable to disease and infection. The entire Mutzachan population is less than 400 million and their culture has almost been eradicated twice, due to plague. Mutzachan have a very low fertility rate, with the females bearing young only once every 100 years. The average life expectancy for a Mutzachan is about 2,000 years.
        * Psychology - Mutzachan pride themselves on making decisions rationally instead of emotionally. This is not to say that the Mutachan are not emotional, but they are ususally able to overcome their emotions. Mutachan are highly ego driven and are very fond of titles and have little patience for insults. Though they are generally consistent and fair to others, they are also famous for being coldhearted and ruthless when the need arises.
        * History - The Mutzachan are an old race, with a history spanning 40,000 years. They have observed the development of the other races without interfering (much). Their sun is old and has been slowly, expelling more radiation over the last million years. Life on their world evolved to not only become resistant to the radiation but to feed on it in a process similar to photosynthesis. A 1000 years ago, the Mutzachans determined that their sun would go nova, destroying their home world. Since then, they have pursued 'The Great Purpose' which is to prevent or mitigate this catastrophe. The Great Purpose has also spawned dangerous nilhilist cults that believe that the Mutzachans do not deserve to continue and should embrace their final destruction in the ultimate nuclear cataclysm.
        * Politics - Their keen intellects and strategic thinking have risen many of their kind to high political office. Most of the high ranking members of the Alliance are either Replicants or Mutzachan. No one really trust the Mutzachan, but then again no one really trusts anybody and the Mutachan are probably better than most."

        * Physiology - Phentari are indigenous to the methane planet Phena in the Tau Ceti star system. They have four sinuous arms, each of which is capable of independent action. This allows the squid to target and fire multiple weapons, or perform multiple independent actions simultaneously. When using edged weapons, the squid attacks like a chain saw. Their tentacles also allow the Phentari to climb quite well. Phentari possess stump like legs which offer little balance. They have long since adopted prosthetic gear to facilitate running. Phena has a 20% methane atmosphere and like the Eridani, the Phentari must wear an atmospheric processor when operating outside of a methane environment.
        * Procreation - Phentari mate every 4 years. After mating, the female attempts to hunt and kill the male. Males who are not resourceful enough to escape have fulfilled their mating potential and are no longer worthy of further mating. The female carries the fertilized eggs for 3 months and then lays a clutch of 3-4 eggs. After egg laying, the female buries the eggs in the ground and then abandons them. Phentari young must fend for themselves after birth, often feeding off of their siblings. Until they mature, Phentari young hide in the shadows and develop their survival and hunting skills. It is not unknown for a group of young to ambush and slay an adult. Of course, when this happens, other Phentari accept that the foolish adult deserved his fate.
        * Personality - Phentari are heartless, selfish creatures who hold all weaker beings in contempt. They use coercion and threats instead of persuation. Phentari are very proud of their kills and will wear jewelry that displays their kill count. They are also fond of decorating their abodes with the skulls of their victims.
        * Skills - Phentari values weapons of all sorts including weapons that other races look down upon such as poisons, diseases, and acids.
        * Government - The Phentari have only had military governments ruled by a council of generals with no individual given absolute power.
        * History - The Phentari have a long, bloody history of civil wars. Since their disasterous war with the Eridani, they have managed to join together against a common foe. They maintain a mutual hatred of the Eridani who seem to want to kill Phentari on sight."

       "* The Pythons are a pair of powerful, lizard races indigenous to the planets Pythos in the Floridian star system.
        * Python Lizards - Python Lizards are aquatic beings, dwelling in the great swamp-like inland seas that cover much of the surface of their home planet. They don't hear sounds as humans do, but rather sense vibrations through their skin. The lizards can dive to depths of 200m and are capable of holding their breath for up to 10 minutes. The drawback is that Python Lizards are sensitive to dry environments and susceptible to cold. When the temperature drops below zero degrees celsius, Pythons usually crawl in some comfortable place and fall asleep. Python Lizards can sense heat sources out to 100m. The lizards are generally less intelligent than their galactic counterparts and have none of their own technology to speak of. They are, however, much more intelligent than their land-based cousins the Rams.
        * Ram Pythons - Unlike their aquatic cousins, Ram Pythons live on land. They are massively powerful and overwhelm even the Python Lizards in combat. However, their intelligence is extremely limited, and they are barely able to be taught how to use modern weaponry.
        * Combat - These great reptiles are the backbone of assault units in the Alliance Marines, proud and defiant warriors whose lifelong ambition is to fight the ultimate battle. The Python is a veritable fighting machine. Unarmed, it attacks with both claws, a vicious bite, and its long prehensile tail. They have a thick, scaly hide that acts as natural leather armor.
        * Personality - These prehistoric dinosaurs are overtly aggressive. The vast majority of Pythons follow a strict code of honor and adamantly adhere to the precepts of law and order.
        * History - The Lizards and Rams are tribal creatures who have fought tribal conflicts for tens of thousands of years. Thir technology was limited to spears and stone axes until the Cizerak sent a diplomatic envoy to the Python Lizards. The Lizards suspected trickery and killed the envoy sparking a punitive attack from the Cizerak. The Lizards and Rams were forced into a humiliating surrender after devastating losses from the Cizerak's cowardly orbital bombardment. The Pythos have not forgiven the Cizerak and will never trust them. Since then, the Alliance has established peaceful relations with the Pythos and have recruited many into Alliance police and military forces."

        * Abilities - They seem no physically stronger or tougher than normal humans merely inured to pain to the point where they care nothing for their injuries or indeed their own lives, and more willing to push their bodies to the extreme because of their madness.
        * Intelligence - Exactly how sentient individual Reavers are remains an open question. Although they clearly must have some retention of any original knowledge prior to their madness (as evidenced by their command of starships and weapons) Reavers are as without fear as they are without mercy,
        * Reavers are believed by most to be men that went insane at the edge of space and became savage. They stared into the void beyond and became what they saw: nothing.
        * Reavers originated from the planet Miranda. The Alliance had been testing behavioral modification on this planet through the chemical G-23 Paxilon Hydrochlorate ([PAX]), administered through the air recycling systems. The chemical was designed to weed out aggression and anger. The ultimate result was that 99.9% of the population stopped going to work, talking to each other, and eventually stopped moving, eating or breeding, and therefore died. However, the remaining tenth of a percent of the population had the opposite reaction, with their aggression and primal instincts boosted beyond simple madness into murderous rage, sadism and xenophobia."

Both sides of this conflict have great resources for the struggle. Indeed, we hope for a long war, for we have no prospects of quick victory ourselves. Our offensive ability is too experimental to neutralize the Raydian threat. A short war can only mean our defeat."
      :summary
       "* The Temporals is a small group of specialists with the technology to travel through time and alter or protect the past.

The Raydian Threat
* The Raydians seem to have been content with the time stream as it was before the Temporals discovered time travel. They seem to be violently opposed to others having time travel ability and may be the cause of the disappearance of the original creators of the Time Rotor.
* Motivation - The Raydians have a strong aversion to disorder. Though they seem to dislike altering history, they are willing to do so to eliminate time travel technology. When choosing historical changes, they tend to favor authoritarian rule and oppose chaotic organizations like democracies.
* Multiple Incursions - Raydians will often make multiple time penetrations at once. The most pastward team will try to effect a change, and the futureward teams wait to see that the change has had the desired effect. If not, they go into action.

Guide to Time Travel
* Don'tt experiment with Time Travel. Many have disappeared and are presumed dead from experimentation. Predicting the outcome of Temporal mechanics is best left to the scientists.
* Don't Alter History. Interfering with major incidents or people or displaying future technology can have disasterous ramifications on the time stream including the destruction of Temporals.
* Avoid Paradoxes. Keep your time jumps to a minimum and carefully log all jumps. If you accidentally encounter a past self, you will trigger a Time Loop Paradox and will be trapped repeating the same series of events unless another time traveller saves you.
* Beware of other Time Travellers. Other travellers outside the Corps exist. Some are friendly. Some are not. Always remember how powerful a weapon time travel is, and do not let it be used against you.
* Keep your presense a secret. One of the most effective ways to dispose of rival time travellers is to identify them, go back in time and ambush them. If no one knows who you are, you will be much safer.
* Time Currents - Time travel is difficult to precisely control. Sometime, travellers are drawn to a particular moment in time (often significant) and may find it hard to leave.
* Law of Death - A person who has never travelled in time is called a Transient or an Ephemeral. That person can have their history rewritten any number of times including being brought back to life. Once a person travels through time, however, they are now called a Temporal and their history is no longer connected to their original timeline. When a Temporal dies, their history ends and nothing can prevent them from dying at that exact age regardless of their location or situation. After a mission is successfully completed, it is standard practice to try to revise the history of any Temporal casualties to inform them of their unavoidable deaths and allow them to live their last time as they choose.

Time Tricks
* False Leads - Opposition time travelers are always looking for information about past activity, so they can go back and ambush you. Creating false information can trick your opponents into creating an ambush that you can ambush instead.
* Gather Allies - Every time period has powerful people. A simple trick is to go pastward and gain someone's trust at an early period and then use that influence later.
* See You in a Minute - Opponent time travelers are always paranoid about being ambushed in the past. Jumping only a few minutes into the future of a conflict can be an unexpected suprise.
* I've Been Here All the Time - A time traveler can hide his Temporal Rotor in an unexpected place, like a jail cell, and use it to travel and return only seconds later. In this way the traveler appears to have never left."

* The complex itself is fantasitcally large. Every room feels palacial. Rooms and doors are built for creatures easily 3 times human height and width with large amounts of open floor space. No furniture exists suggesting the forerunners never sat or lay down. Most of the floors are covered with a soft, spongy material that serves as carpeting and indicates that the forerunners had sensitive feet or undersides. There are no stairs, only ramps and lifts of unknown construction. Rooms are apparently self cleaning, while lights and displays appear spontaneously from featureless walls.
* Spacedock - One of the many scientific labs has been retrofitted into a functional spacedock for smaller craft.
* Power Plant - The power section appears to be a single giant corridor with minimal instrumentation ending in a huge vault door with a black orb suspended over it.
* Eye of Harmony - Beyond the vault door lies a small black hole held in perfect balance by completely reflecting its own devastating gravitational force back upon itself. The technology to achieve this feat lies completely outside of our understanding.
* History - A scientific team accidentally discovered that a seemingly non-descript moon was a technological marvel left by a long dead civilization. Within lay a massive complex and elegant advanced technology. But most remarkable of all, the moon was hollow and contained, at its core, a small black hole held in perfect symmetrical stasis by unfathomable forces. The scientists immediately knew that this technology was far too advanced to share with any political group. So they kept it a secret and studied it. Disturbingly, the race who built it left no record of their existence.  No trace of language, personality, or even habitation of the station remained. It was as if they had never existed. Common conjecture claims that they were somehow erased from history. Years later, the scientists discoverd the purpose of the asteroid and the black hole it contained: to enable individuals to travel through the center of the black hole and travel back through time. The first few trips back were uneventful besides learning some important lessons about causality, but soon the travelers found that they had attracted the attention of another time traveling race, the [Radiance]. And thus began a strange battle of attrition between the the Radiance and what would become the Temporals with all of the Past, Present, and Future hanging in the balance."

No record can be found of their cultures or their bodies, and the Temporal Rotor will not travel to any point in their history, presumably as a fail-safe against temporal manipulation. The fact that no trace of their race exists except the Temporal Rotor is disturbing and leads to speculation that they were somehow wiped out by their own device or another time travelling species. Some speculate that the Chronans were eliminated by the Radiance, and that their fate is what the Temporals can expect if the Radiance is victorious, perhaps leading to the erasure of the entire human race from history.
* The vast, vaulted corridors and rooms of Chronos Station lead one to believe that these creatures were bulky masses about 10-15 feet (3-5m) tall. The lack of stairs implies that the creatures were legless, but that could just be a comfort or aesthetic choice.")

This goal is obviously, hopelessly unattainable. To devote the entire resources and enegies of one's race and culture to an unattainable outcome must be called madness. Among humans, it is a common fantasy to 'rule the world', 'rule the galaxy', or 'rule the universe'. These pipedreams are almost always the stuff of fiction and fantasy, 	designed to entertain. Those who have taken them seriously are regarded as madmen. Now imagine even fantasizing about 'ruling every point in time in every dimension'. The very concept is laughable, yet the Radiance takes this seriously and are committed to acheiving it. Despite its insanity, their efforts pose a serious threat to everyone, everywhere, everywhen."

           "* The Radiance is an enormous energy being of vast power originating from a time near the birth of the universe. It has been content to bask in the fantastic energies of the Big Bang until it perceived the use of time travel. The Radiance is completely committed to what it considers a peacefyl, orderly universe, and the ripples created by time travellers are something it cannot allow.
* The Radiance can project parts of itself through time and space though it is loath to do so. These projections appear as columns of energy that wield vast destructive power.
* As a being of pure Order, the Radiance appreciates order and despises chaos of any kind. It prefers authoritarian rule over democracies. It dislikes individual expression, but it does appreciate art and beauty.
* The Temporals have assumed that the Radiance projections are an entire race of energy creatures instead of a single being and have misinterpreted its name as Raydians."

           "* Description - The Temporal Rotor is an amazing device created by a vanished civilization. It is mostly a communication device that can reach into the Temporal Vortex and communicate with the central computer Chronos on the asteroid Babylon. Chronos harnesses the black hole hidden within Bablyon to move the Time Rotor and its operator through time and space. It is perhaps the most powerful device ever created.
* Activating the Temporal Rotor - When the Temporal Rotor is activated, static electricity begins to build in the area. At full strength the static is dangerous, so travellers should not move to avoid discharge. A glowing field begins to form. Travellers heart rate begins to climb and they have a sudden feeling of intense, unnatural danger and imminent death. Hearts begin to fibrilate and flatline.
* Entering the Vortex - The travellers blink and become aware that they are in the Vortex. Further, they recognize that they have always been in the Vortex. Every moment of their life remembered as if it just occurred. Only their future remains unseen. Time in the Vortex has no meaning, so travellers may leave immediately or stay for an eternity before moving on.
* Leaving the Vortex - Leaving is just as traumatic as entering. As the Temporal Rotor slows, the travellers begin to forget all that they have just remembered. It is like losing one's mind bit by bit. They feel torn apart and incomplete. Soon they start losing coherent thought, their minds becoming simple and primal. Their senses and desires become simple: Food, Sex, Fear, Violence, Warmth ... Food, Fear, Violence, Warmth ... Food, Warmth ... Warmth. All is dark, wet, and warm as it has always been. Soft, pink bubbles surround and comfort you. You have no wants. You are complete. Suddenly a bright light blinds you, and happiness and security are torn from you. And there is pain, pain where there never was pain before. Waves of burning pain crush you, chew you up, and spit you out. You lie on the ground, cold and in shock. A new pressure builds in your chest, and without thinking you gasp and take in your first breath. Your eyes open to see the last lights on the Temporal Rotor wink out. You are coverered in a heavy, red jelly like congealed blood. The jelly quickly dries to dust and disappears. You rise and feel healthier than ever before. Old wounds and scars are gone as if they never were, and you are different: your skin, your teeth, your hair, your language all are as if you were born and lived your life in this time and place. Your equipment is gone and your clothes have been replaced with simple native garb: a gift from Chronos."
