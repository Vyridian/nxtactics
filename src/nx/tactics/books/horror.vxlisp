    * Like [Undead], they exist partially in the [Spirit Realm], are immune to most hostile environments, and appear blurry in photograph and other recordings.
    * If their body is destroyed, their Spirit leaves the body and enters the [Spirit Realm] fully. Their bodies age will rapidly catch up to it usually causing it to deteriorate rapidly. Normally their spirit never returns to the physical world, but if they are powerful enough, they may find their way back through the Veil and even death may not stop them from returning."

          :summary
           "* The Dreamlands is a vast [Dreamworld] that is a favorite of many Earth dreamers. Experienced dreamers are among the most powerful inhabitants of the Dreamlands and some become permanent residents after their physical deaths.
            * To reach the Dreamlands, a sleeper must find an unusual stairway in a conventional dream and walk down the Seventy Steps of Light Slumber to face the judgment of powerful gatekeepers named Nasht and Kaman-Tha. If judged worthy (that is, able to survive the dangers of the Dreamlands), the dreamer is allowed to descend the Seven Hundred Steps of Deeper Slumber and emerges in the Enchanted Wood.
            * When entering the Dreamlands this way, the person leaves his or her physical body safely in the waking world. If the dreamer is killed during his or her travels, the person's corporeal body will suffer only a shock. Sometimes, however, this can be fatal - dream death of this kind makes return to the Dreamlands impossible. Waking up causes a person's dream self to disappear; thus the individual may have difficulty recalling anything learned or experienced while asleep (similar to conventional dreaming). A dreamer who dies in the real world while his dream self is still alive may have the option of retiring to the Dreamlands for the remainder of his dream self's 'life.'
            * The Dreamlands can be entered in other ways, including physically. This usually requires passing through very dangerous areas of both the waking world and the Dreamlands. Consequently, real death becomes a risk. However, the visitor does receive the prolonged lifespan of a native of the Dreamlands, so the traveler's time there is no longer limited to the duration of a night's sleep on earth.
            * Time flows at a different rate in the Dreamlands - each hour on earth represents a week or more there. Consequently, a traveler can spend months in the Dreamlands during a single night's sleep on earth. Fortunately for dreamers, inhabitants of the Dreamlands are either long-lived or immortal, provided they avoid injury or disease.
            * Despite its accelerated time, the Dreamlands rarely experiences change.  Its geography, politics, and population remain fairly static.  Dreamers, however, can exert great change over the topography, such as by creating entire cities with accompanying populations.

            Geography
            * The West is the most well-known region of the Dreamlands and is probably the most inhabited as well. It is where dreamers emerge from the Steps of Deeper Slumber. The port of Dylath-Leen, the largest city of the Dreamlands, lies on its coast. The town of Ulthar, where no man may kill a cat, is also located here. Other important cities are Hlanith (a coastal jungle city) and Ilarnek (a desert trade capital). The land of Mnar and the ruins of Sarnath are found at the southern border. The Enchanted Wood of the zoogs is also found here. It joins the South.
            * The South is the southern coastal region of the continent shared by the West along with the islands of the Southern Sea, including the isle of Oriab, the largest. The South's land-locked regions and its coastal areas are known as the Fantastic Realms, because they contain nightmarish and sometimes incomprehensible zones. Otherwise, the islands of the Southern Sea are fairly normal.
            * The East is a continent that is largely uninhabited, except for Ooth-Nargai. The city of Celephais the capital of Ooth-Nargai and was created from whole cloth by its monarch King Kuranes, the greatest of all recorded dreamers. Beyond Ooth-Nargai are The Forbidden Lands, dangerous realms into which travel is interdicted.
            * The North is a cold, mountainous continent notorious for its Plateau of [Leng], a violent region shared by man-eating spiders and satyr-like beings known as the &quot;Men of Leng&quot;. The North also has a number of friendlier places, such as the city of Inganok, famous for its onyx quarries. The deepest reaches of the North are said to hold Unknown [[Kadath]], the home of the Great Ones.
            * The Underworld is a subterranean region that runs beneath the whole of the Dreamlands. Its principle inhabitants are ghouls, who can physically enter the waking world through crypts. The Underworld is also home to the gugs, monstrous giants banished from the surface for untold blasphemies. The Underworld's deepest realm is the Vale of Pnath, a dangerous lightless chasm inhabited by enormous unseen beasts called bholes. Bholes are likely the ancestors of the Dholes of Yaddith.
            * The Moon has a parallel in the Dreamlands and is inhabited by the dreaded moon-beasts, amorphous frog-like creatures allied with Nyarlathotep. Interestingly, it is possible for a ship to sail off the edge of the Dreamlands and travel through space to the moon.
            * Kadath - Kadath or Unknown Kadath is the dwelling place of the Great Ones. It is a gigantic castle found atop an immense cosmic mountain in the Cold Waste.  Kadath is the place where the dreamlands gods dwell, but it is inaccessible to mortals because the gods do not want to be bothered."

The room is lit by sunlight pouring through wide windows overhead. This sunlight never changes despite weather or time of day.
                * Hallways - The radiating spokes of hallways are lined with bookshelves and go a long distance into darkness. Halls connecting the spokes appear every 100 feet. The books are divided by subject but are then only organized by age with newer books closer to the center. A light source is needed if one travels down the corridors. After several hundred yards the parchment scrolls and conventional books give way to carved wooden, stone, clay, or metal plaques. Beyond these even more bizarre methods of information storing appear, formed from crystals, ghosts enslaved to repeat specific lore, huge bottles of sinister looking liquid that must be drank to obtain the knowledge, and so forth. The languages used become more alien, and dreamers may encounter Serpent People or Elder Things in the very distant past.

Others are bizarre - panoramas of endless cemeteries, twisted trees hung with countless skulls, dinosaurs stalking ruined cities. One is a portrait of a scientist or physician in the grisly act of dissecting himself with a scalpel and examining his organs under magnification.

It also contains records of the habits of Great Old Ones such as Abhoth, Atlach-Nacha, Rlim Shaikorth and Tsathoggua (the later being a deity whom Eibon was particularly favored by).

When they attempted to colonize the oceans, the polyps were driven back by the Elder Things. Thereafter, they restricted their habitats to the surface world.
           * Their senses did not include sight, but what senses they had could penetrate all material obstructions. They were only partially matter, but still solid enough to affect and be stopped by normal materials; this additionally gave them resistance, if not outright invulnerability, to normal means of damage, though they could be destroyed by certain forms of electrical energy. Their minds were so strange that the Great Race of Yith could not perform psychic transfers with them.
           * They are able to levitate and fly despite lacking any visible means of doing so, and leave telltale massive footprints when on the ground. Their amorphous bodies can turn invisible at will, though this ability appears somewhat negated by whistling noises associated with them in general. In battle, their ability to control and direct powerful winds is put to use as a weapon.
           * When the Great Race of Yith came to Earth, they warred with the polyps and soon drove them underground with their advanced technology. The Great Race then sealed the entryways to the polyps' subterranean abode with trapdoors, which afterwards were diligently guarded. The polyps' cities were left abandoned, perhaps as a reminder of the horrors that dwelt below.
           * Eventually, the polyps rose up and almost exterminated the Great Race, afterwards returning to their subterranean haunts.

           * Seeds of Azathoth - Nemesis is, in reality, a Spawn of Azathoth that has clung to orbit around the Sun. Occasionally, pieces of Nemesis break free, falling into the solar system: the Seeds of Azathoth. Seeds that strike the Sun are destroyed, but if a seed strikes a planet, it can melt into the planet's core where it grows immensely, eventually forming a new Spawn which emerges from the broken planet like a snake from an egg. Our system's original fifth world was so parasitized. Its remnants compose the asteroid belt.
           * For millenia, human and other astronomers have seen in comets, 'hairy stars', approaching disaster and ill-fortune. In ancient texts, comets have been blamed for the revolt of the Shoggoths against the Elder Things, the doom of the dinosaurs, the fall of the empire of the Serpent People, the destruction of Hyperborea, the sinking of Atlantis, and even the two ages of chaos that struck early Egypt.

Most are symbolic acts upon the death of a family member or friend, but on occasion the ritual is actually performed using a monkey or ape substitued for a human. Of particular interest is a brain eating custom where the brain is exposed and eaten directly from the skull while still warm. An elderly native said that he had seen apes killing smaller monkeys and eating their brains in similar manner.
                   ** A diary including comments about:
                   *** His brother Julian sudden sickness and retirement after returning from the Andaman Islands.
                   *** Julian's subsequent suicide attempt
                   *** Cynthia's trip to the Andaman Islands and subsequent abduction by savages.
                   *** Her later release
                   *** Arguments with his sons over favoritism
                   *** His recent series of nightmares
                   *** His therapy with Julian over his nightmares and the drug Julian prepared to help him sleep.
                   *** The ultra-realistic new dreams after the drug put him into an especially deep sleep.
                   *** Julian's refusal to provide more of the drug.
                   *** Phillip's break-in of Julian's house and the successful theft of the drug.

                   * The attic contains a formerly extinct prehistoric spider that was in the crate of coconuts. It had bitten Phillip in his sleep and put him into a deep coma that was mistaken for death. The spider venom causes unconsciousness in 10 minutes, but the victim will revive on its own within two days.")))

The attack is not life threatening, but if the person bleeds the divers will have to return to the surface for fear of attracting sharks.

The falling diver can attempt to jump free, failing that he can scramble to grab the coral reef as he falls, otherwise he slowly falls 30 feet before the coral cuts his air hose and he drowns.

The reality is that the ghoul cult has been robbing graves for years. Father Garcia has been noticing activity in the night and has been hiding in the church at night to try to catch someone in the act. Unfortunately, he found the graverobbers and confronted them. They immediately killed him and called the Detective to cover up the murder.

He is also a member of a secret death cult that worships ghouls. His cult was graverobbing for their riturals when the Father caught them and he was dispensed with. Colin's drinking made him a convenient scapegoat, so the Detective is constructing circumstantial evidence to arrest Colin. Later he will arrange for Colin to hang himself in jail. If the investigators get too close to the cult, he will arrange an ambush to eliminate them.

In the narrative, it is found that although the abductors initially tried to take her by force, that after a short conversatiion, she agreed to go with them and was returned safely the next day. Major Nichols has only met Cynthia twice, since she rarely comes to Port Blair.")

                   "* Guides - If they request, Major Nichols will provide two Indian guides to lead them to Cynthia's clinic 45 miles away. However, he does warn that the two are criminals, working off their crimes. Worse, there are 2 escaped criminals known to be in the area. They are desperate killers and could be extremely dangerous.
                   * Sikander - A Hindu in his mid-thirties with a wife and three children on the island. He stole a horse and has served eight years so far but is mostly trustworthy. He will, however, steal a weapon for protecting his family if he gets the chance. If successful, he will hide the weapon in the jungle for future retrieval.
                   * Mahbub - A Moslem from Delhi who has served twenty years so far for murder. He speaks little English and is neither garrulous nor energetic.
                   * The Jungle - The trip to Cynthia's clinic starts on timber roads, then footpaths, but before the first day is over they are struggling through thick growths and shallow swamps with no path. The trip takes three days or more, and the guides prove able servants, doing all the work of setting up camp, building a fire, and preparing meals.
                   * The Villiage - A loud buzzing noise emanates from a clearing ahead with a tiny, abandoned villiage. The buzzing comes from a tree with a crude platform 25 feet up. Atop the platform is a rotted human form covered in a mass of undulating insects that are devouring it. Although the Andamanese normally bury their dead, if a particularly revered chief dies, he is bundled in a tree and the clan abandons their villiage for three months in reverence. If the body is disturbed, the Jarawan hunters will track the intruders and attempt to kill them for their blasphemy.
                   * The Mission - Cynthia has a small wooden building that serves as her clinic surrounded by the huts of 20 Andamanese. Nearly a mile from the beach can be seen a 6 mile island covered with dense jungle. If local tribesman believe the island is evil, and only Cynthia has returned alive from it. The inhabitants of the island rarely leave, and when they do it is only to kidnap and kill.
                   * Cynthia Baxter - Cynthia is a large woman, big-boned and slightly overweight. She is very near-sighted, and her voice is high pitched and squeaky. Cynthia will act hospitable to strangers, but she is highly suspiscious of those who would appear at this critical moment in her life. She lost her mother at 8 year old. She nearly died from a spider bite and 12 and began thinking of becoming a catholic nun. Instead, with the  encouragement of Uncle Julian, she studied medicine in college. Julian helped her get through medical school, and she is deeply grateful to him. To impress Julian, she became a medical missionary and travelled to the Adamans in 1913. In 1918, she was kidnapped by the Tcho-Tchos from the small island across the strait. The Tcho-Tcho priest saw the mark of the spider on her, and trained her in the nature of Atlach-Nacha, their horrible spider god. Cynthia never had a strong personality and was easily brainwashed and converted to the terrible worship. The priest has convinced her that she has a special detiny (which is horribly true), and now only Julian might be able to turn her from her path.
                   * Cynthia's Journal - In her hut is a journal that describes her facination with the teachings of the Tcho-Tcho priest and her belief that a new sun shall appear in the sky. The journal describes the arrival of Silas Patterson and his interest in the Tcho-Tcho rituals. She also writes of her mixed feeling about sending the 'present' to her father, but the priest insists that he cannot be allowed to interfere.")

                    * Tcho Tcho Tribesman - The Tcho Tcho are more asian in appearance than the average Adaman. They are all violent fanatics and will hunt down and capture anyone who invades their island. There are 10 males, 6 females, and 3 children on the island.
                    * Tcho Tcho Priest - The Tcho Tcho priest leads his tribe. He is a long time explorer in the Dreamlands and there he has the form of a twisted dwarf (reflecting his personality). In combat, the priest stands back and casts spells (Dread Curse of Azathoth and Withered Limb) while his comrades fight and die.
                    * Fossil Quarry - An exposed rock in the jungle is covered with fossils of prehistoric arthopods including millipedes, scorpions, and spiders. This rock is the source of the spider from the Baxter home, brought to life by the Child of Atlach-Nacha spell cast by the Tcho Tcho priest. A single enormous spider six-feet across can be found here, and the priest will animate this spider if he gets the chance. Note: Any damaged fossil cannot be reanimated.
                    * Obelisk - In a clearing near the villiage rises a black stone, twenty foot monolith. Though weathered by time, precise geometric designs are clearly visible. These designs are are disturbing to the eye and create a sense of vertigo. Out of the corner of one's eye, they seem to swirl and pulse. If one listens to the stone an almost impercetible rhythmic throbbing can be heard. Crude stones are set up around the obelisk covered in primitive drawings of spiders chasing and consuming tiny humans as shooting stars fall from the heavens.
                    * Metamorphosis - On the night Cynthia is 'kidnapped', she goes directly to the Obelisk. There the tribesmen have gathered to begin the ceremony. Near the Obelisk are bound the 2 escaped killers that Major Nichols warned of as well as any other captured males. Cynthia stands before the altar, removes her clothes and sways to the Tcho Tcho songs. Eventually, she stops, bends over, and the skin along her back splits wide open, revealing a shiny black surface that pulses horribly. As the wrinkling empty skin of Cynthia Baxter is pushed forward, multple legs spill out from the discarded molt, waving feebly, as the huge spider-thing pushes clear. The priest dones Cynthia's discarded skin and wears it like a coat.
                    * The Wedding Feast - Cynthia's new form is not hard enough to move freely until dawn. In the meantime, she is ceremonially wedded to the male sacrifices before she drags herself to each one and begins eating the flesh from the victims head. She finally sucks the brains out through the eyesockets. Each feast takes 20 minutes, and after each is consumed, the still animate corpses with exposed skulls are freed and shamble mindlessly off into the forest. The Onge people sense the threat of the Tcho Tcho and attack the Tcho Tcho. The Tcho Tcho defend Cynthia and the priest as they escape. The Onge will not pursue the Tcho Tcho into jungle at night. Instead the free any remaining prisoners and wait for light. The priest makes his way to the prehistoric rock and casts Child of Atlach-Nacha to animate the giant spider there.
                    * Daughter of Atlach-Nacha - At dawn, Cynthia is fully formed and begins a 3 hour trek across the island to the Caverns of Atlach-Nacha. She is accompanied by hordes of spiders that crawl around and over her. Any who follow will constantly be treading on spiders and have spiders dropping upon them from the trees. Their bites are painful but are not dangerous.
                    * Caverns of Atlach-Nacha - Cynthia travels to a 20 foot cave opening where her father dwells. If she is pursued, she will wait in ambush for her  pursuers. If the investigators are foolish enough to continue searching, they will travel through twisting caverns deeper and deeper for over an hour before the cave opens into a vast chasm nearly filled with thick, ropy webs. Continued activity attracts [Atlach-Nacha] himself who resembles a hideous, black, hairy spider with a strange, remotely human-like face with little red, hair-rimmed eyes.")))

                   * Procession of Burgomaster Kranon - Trumpets announce a parade throught the streets for Burgomaster Kranon. The Burgomaster is immediately recognizable as Matthew, Julian Baxter's ward. In the Dreamlands, his emotional and mental handicaps don't exist. If the investigators can get an audience, Krannon can be convinced to help them, both here and in the real world.
                   * Cthaat Aquadingen - At the [Library at Ultar], the investigators can search for the [Cthaat Aquadingen]. The book is bound in soft, human skin, still pliable, and always moist from perspiration welling from its pores. Simply handling the book is creepy. Within the book can be found a quote: The stars fall, the beast bred of stone rampages, and a time of great change comes. Deep within perfumed Kled, where life turns to death, the Watcher in the Glade knows the time and place of the coming. Chinese notes are written in the margin of the page. If they are translated, they comment that the Pnankotic Manuscripts mentions the Watcher in the Glade.
                   * Pnakotic Manuscripts - If read, the manuscripts describe that the Watcher in the Glade is the Great Old One Yibb-Tstil. Priests of Yibb-Tstil meet at the great pool in front of the ivory palace. Priests then grovel on hands and knees before Yibb-Tstil and must not look upon him.
                   * Carnival - While leaving Ultar, the dreamers chance upon a carnival tent. A barker announces that they have the only captive Colossal purple spider from the distant north. Admission is a dime or anything of value. The interior of the tent is larger than the outside would suggest, and in a barred cage at the back of the tent is a purple spider the size of a car hovering over the dessicated body of a sheep. If anyone tries to talk to the spider, it speaks in a thin, dry voice. It is, however, not helpful and eventually hisses. The barker comes running in and ushers them out. If they want to speak more, the barker says: 'It is not up to me you see'. The spider then says: 'After all, I am the master here.' If the barker is questioned about the dwarf who works here, he tells them the dwarf quit some time ago and headed to Kled.")

                    * Numerous ivory palaces dot the jungles. If the dreamers ask about the great pool mentioned in the Pnakotic Manuscripts, the guides recognize it as the Palace of the Sacred Fount.
                    * Palace of the Sacred Fount - The palaces is one of the less feared places, though it is still avoided. As with other ivory palaces in Kled, the palace is somehow physically in perfect condition though the rooms are empty and the floors are thick with dirt and leaves. The smell in the area is a unique musky odor that immediately reminds the dreamers of the smell during the dream of the death of Phillip Baxter. The front hallway is an atrium where rain water falls to collect in a rectangular pool. At the far end of the pool stands a huge jade statue of an evil-looking hyena. The statue leers with gaping jaws over the pool. The apparently bottomless pool is dark and filthly from rotting leaves, a peculiar oily film covers its surface. Despite its appearance the pool is not dangerous.
                    * Phillip's Ghost - A distant cackling sound can be heard. Following the sound, the dreamers find a stairway going down many flights with torchlight below. At the bottom of the stairs, the dreamers find a torchlit hallway with a cell at the end. Within a cackling dwarf uses a human femur to visciously beat a glowing, partially headless, staggering figure. The dwarf is hunched and misshapen and has a terrible, inhuman face. Its lips are drawn into a snarl over three-inch fangs. Its eyes are glowing red pits. The figure is the dreamform of Phillip Baxter. If he is rescued, his headless form is mindless and helpless. The dwarf with not help under any circumstances.
                    * Path to Yib-Tstll - Behind the Palace the jungle becomes stunted and twisted, tree trunks are bent at odd angles, and a general sense of disease pervades the growth. Futher on, alien foliage begins to appear including quivering fungi and twisting weird ferns. Further still, a great stone arch can be seen surrounded by dead trees. Through the arch can be seen another alien jungle evidently on a far-off world. The arch is clearly a permanent gate, and plants and insects can be seen crossing both ways as if the arch were simple stone.
                    * World of Yib-Tstll - Beyond the arch, the sky is dark green and starless. Swollen insects swoop ominously from deadly-looking blooms. Flying horrors with veinous wings fly high above. Not far away, a vast, black clearing is visible.
                    * The Clearing - The clearing is roughly a mile across. The black surface is composed of fine flakes like snow, but it is warm to the touch. If the dreamers heed the Pnakotic Manuscripts, they should crawl on hands and knees across the black clearing facing the ground to avoid actually seeing Yibb-Tstll. As the dreamers near the center, Yib-Tstll rises suddenly from the black clearing. Dreamers may attempt to avert their gaze or suffer the madness induced by his presence.
                    * [Yibb-Tstll] - The massive being speaks telepathically with a booming alien voice. Each dreamer must make a [Spirit] test or Yibb-Tstll will ignore that person completely. If the test is completely failed, Yibb-Tstll will touch the person and impart its feared reversal. Yibb-Tstll is suprisingly helpful and will answer questions about the Cthulhu Mythos and things of cosmic import including Nemesis, but he will only give a single answer on a subject and will not clarify himself.
                    * Reversals - Any dreamer who suffers a reversal will instantly be driven insane or his human form or dream form will be permanently killed. If an insane dreamer is brought to him, Yibb-Tstll will fully restore his sanity. If the dwarf is present, Yibb-Tstll will reverse him, and his dream form will change into the Tcho-Tcho priest while his real form will become the dwarf. If the headless form and the ghoul's page are brought before him, he touches them both and Phillip Baxter's dream fomr is restored, but back in the real world, Silas Patterson has become a mad imitation of Phillip Baxter.
                    * Web of Eibon - Yibb-Tstll instructed Eibon in his construction of the Web of Eibon spell with which he planned to freeze time around Nemesis (and Earth) to prevent Earth's destruction. Yibb-Tstll knows his efforts will fail in the end, but it provided the instructions anyway.")

Suddenly, the dream sharpens and 3 figures start crawling from an open grave: ghouls like the ones that may have been seen at St. Augustine. The ghouls stinking breath reeks of death and decay. The ghouls do not appear to be hostile, instead they start urging the investigators to come with them to see the wise man and there is little time left before dawn. A terrific stench issues from the open grave. Below rotten bits of wood and fabric lie on the grave floor and a narrow, twisting tunnel leads into darkness. The ghouls gibber that they must hurry and start climbing down the hole. If the dreamers don't follow the tunnel begins to slowly close. If the dreamers still do not follow, they awake normally, but the opportunity to learn more has been lost. If they do follow, the tunnel collapses behind them and they will have to follow the ghouls forward.
                   * Grath the Leader - Young and handsome by ghoul standards, Grath leads the group and most often speaks with the dreamers. He had a riding zebra, but the group got hungry and ate most of it.
                   * Mairpl the Big - Mairpl is much larger than the others, speaks little, and wields a club in battle.
                   * Ug the Hungry - The worst and most degenerate of them, Ug speak no human language and spends most of his time on four legs. He avoids the humans, but can often be seen staring and drooling over them. He possess no threat, but he likes to fantasize.
                   * The Page - At the end of the tunnel waits the Page. The Page is wrapped in a dirty brown cloak with his face hidden. His body is bent forward and staggers under the weight of an enormous tombstone chained to his back. The ghouls order the Page around and play viscious practical jokes on him. Below the hood can be found Sila Patterson's face, though it shows no recognition. Upon the tombstone is written 'Phillip A. Baxter 1865-1925.' The Page is, of course, the dream form of Silas Patterson, suffering from the guilt of the death of his friend.
                   * The Quest - The ghoul gang seeks to rescue a female ghoul Horella who has disappeared. The ghouls are fairly melodramatic about how beautiful she is and how they must rescue her from whatever peril she is in. To find Horella, they seek the insight of the wise Man of the Mountain. This man supposedly is very wise and will answer any questions.
                   * Social Ettiquette - After a few hours of travel, the ghouls stop for nourishment. They squat down and rummage through their stained sacks. They produce vaguely familiar cuts of raw meat with tinges of green along with sour wine. The source of the meat is all too obvious. The ghouls like their food well-aged and, out of respect, offer their guests the oldest pieces. The bags also contain the remains of Grath's zebra which the ghouls are more than happy to hand over, leaving the tastier pieces for themselves.")

Many ohter tunnels branch off, but the ghouls seem to know their way. Drinking water oozes down the rock wall. Bloated fungi, pale, foot-long crickets, and eyeless carnivorous rats server as food. Most of the trip is in complete darkness. Occasionally, luminescent fungi provide a tiny amount of light. The tunnels connect the Vaults of Zin where dangerous ghasts, serpent folk, or worse may be encountered. Eventually, the group exits the Underworld at the border of the [Stony Desert].
                   * [Stony Desert] - Grath says the journey eastward across the desert will only take a few days. They seek the sacred mountain [Mt. Hatheg-Kla] where a holy man can tell them where fair Horella can be found.
                   * Walker of the Stony Desert - A few days journey into the desert, the dreamers see, off in the distance, a man leading a horse. They will meet in about an hour. As they draw near, it is clear that the man is enormous, towering over the horse. He is 8 feet tall, 400 lbs, and dressed all in black. His horse seems old and tired and lags behind being pulled by a rope. The horse is an elderly nag with cataract films covering both eyes. The ghouls are terrified of the man and will not approach. He does not stop walking unless he is attacked. This being is the dream-form of Eibon, the Hyperborean wizard who, like the spell he cast to capture Eibon is bound to travel back and forth across the Stony Desert. A legend says that one day he shall find a way out of the desert. On that day, the horse shall be healthy and the man shall then ride the horse. Where he goes then, he does not know for the horse shall be the master. He freely discusses his trip across the desert, Mythos knowledge, Nemesis, and his spell the Web of Eibon that Yibb-Tstl taught him. He now knows that stagnation is worse than destruction by Nemesis. If asked about Nemesis, he produces a large, shining jewel from the air and offers it to the dreamers. He says simply that all brave souls will know what to do when the time comes. Any attempt to attack Eibon results in him disappearing and reappearing far in the distance continuing his endless travels.")

The other ghouls will wait here while Mairpl and any brave dreamers attempt the climb. The way up seems somewhat trecherous and will require a [Climb] roll to succeed. If that roll fails, a second [Climb] roll must be made to catch yourself before you fall to your doom. Unfortunately, Mairpl fails both rolls and falls far below splattering on the rocks and potentially injuring those below. After a short period of remorse, Grath and Ug gather some of the larger pieces and add them to their provision bags.

He deftly uses a silver hatchet to cut pieces of the corpses and flings the dripping gobbets above his head as the circling Byakhees swoop down to catch them from the air. As the dreamers approach, the Byakhee scream and chatter, but the man pays them no mind. If hailed, he smiles warmly, and if asked questions he will honestly answer based on his vast knowledge of the Dreamlands and the Mythos. Knowledge comes at a price, so before he answers each question, he hurls his hatchet at the questioner which instantly slices off an appendage, starting with a hand. The Byakhee swoop down and eat the tidbit. The wound does not bleed and only hurts for a moment. The damage is permanent in the Dreamlands, but each time a dreamer returns to the Dreamlands one wound is healed. If asked, he tells that Horella is at the castle of Bombel, the giant, in the hills to the east of the [Stony Desert]. Anyone foolish enough to attach the man, is attacked by the Byakhee, rended to pieces, and eaten.

A flight of steps, each one foot wide, criss-crosses back and forth up the slope. Anyone nearing the opening hears a deep sobbing and suckling sound as if from some enormous infant. The cave itself is completely black and no light will penetrate it. If anyone enters, a few seconds later, horrifying screams of agony echo from the cave accompanied by sucking, popping sounds and a soft, cooing voice. The screams continue for almost a minute before they are choked off by a gurgling, bubbling sound and a huge spray of blood that shoots from the cave. The character's dream-self is dead, and his waking self has been driven mad by the horrific dreamform of Nemesis.")

This is Horella, and she immediately begins hurling vile insults and rocks at the Gug. The ghouls are cheered on by her presence, but if someone listens they realize that she is exhorting Bombel to kill the intruders. Dreamers may also notice previous bruises on Bombel's head. If Bombel falls, Horella turns her insults and rocks at her would-be rescuers. Any remaining ghouls grab a chain from their bags, say 'To the rescue', capture Horella, and drag her bumping down the stairs.

                    * Road to Lhasa - The 400 mile journey to Lhasa can only be taken on foot or via horse-drawn caravan. The route is heavily trafficked by pilgrims, traders, smugglers, and spies. The journey takes weeks and is alternately terrifying, boring, facinating, cold, and misery-making.
                    * Lhasa - Lhasa is a sprawling squat city with no building taller than 2 stories except for the Potala, the home of the Dalai Lama. The Potala is a bulky, stone structure that is imposing but unattractive.
                    * The British Legation - The Legation is on the outskirts of Lhasa. Here Francis Wilson has residence. He seems thinner and more stressed than at the funeral. He has been researching the Tunguska Blast and mad Rasputin's apparent presence at the blast. After piecing together his research, he illegally entered the Soviet Union and stole parts of Rasputin's journal. He then fled to Tibet through Mongolia. He has been translating sections since then. He claims that Rasputin met someone called Eibon in his dreams, and that this Eibon told him of his own death. Eibon also warned him of a dark star that would fall from the sky. This Eibon gave him a stone that he used to destoy the star. He further foretells another dark star that would fall long after Rasputin's death in Tibet. Francis guesses that the place may be near an abandoned temple roughly 300 miles north of Lhasa. He has found a guide Lha-bzang who studied in the temple as a child.
                    * Lha-bzang - Francis plans to travel there soon with a native Tibetan, Lha-bzang. Lha-bzang is a domden, a Tibetan mortician. A skilled Anthropologist may recall that Tibetan funeral rites involve the corpse being hacked to bits by the axe-wielding domden and then fed to ravens or vultures. Lha-bzang's dream form is the holy man on the mountain. Lha-bzang is going on the journey to expand his spiritual understanding. Unfortunately, he has also been paid off by a Soviet spy. If questioned about the temple, he says he was sold as a slave as a child but he fled the temple when he realized that their teachings were not Buddhist.
                    * Ivan Dorkyev - A Soviet spy who has been tracking Francis down since Francis stole Rasputin's journal in Leningrad. He is over 6 feet tall and is dressed in the tattered robes of a yak-herder. Beneath, he carries two pistols, a knife, and a bandolier of ammo. He hides at his camp in the mountains near the ruins waiting for Lha-bzang to bring Francis.
                    * Trip to the Ruins - Lha-bzang leads the expedition 300 miles through a tangle of steep mountain passes, brackish lakes, and arid valleys. On the way, they encounter kay-herders, small mountain monasteries, and moutain farms. About 2 weeks in to the trip, while camped, a minor earth tremor shakes everyone awake. A week laker, they arrive at the Nenmka temple, sitting on the slope of a mountain.
                    * The Temple - The temple is now just a windswept ruin. A Mythos knowledge test reveals that the fallen columns have inscriptions used to invoke Hastur. The Soviet spy has watched the investigators approach and waits in hiding nearby. Lha-bzang finds a section of flooring with symbols on a tile. Here he will perform a ceremony to discover more about Nemesis.
                    * The Ceremony - Lha-bzang sits and lights a clay pipe containing a tarball of hashish. He passes the pipe around and then begins a droning wail. After 30 minutes, he retrieves a knife and a freshly severed human hand from his bag. He cuts his own palm, smears blood on the hand, and binds the cut. He then passes the knife to each person to do the same. If any will not, he gestures for them to leave the prayer circle. After another 5 minutes, the hand twitches and then turns toward Lha-bzang. He asks where can they find the Seed of Nemesis. The hand then crawls to a symbols on the ground indicating 'not far' and 'north-east'. Additional questions may be asked but each question causes the questioner to receive a minor Sanity Wound. Answers are always very short, and the hand only knows local events. The Soviet spy waits nearby but has accepted Lha-bzang's demand to allow the ceremony to complete before acting.
                    * Confrontation - Just as the ceremony is concluded, Ivan steps into the room brandishing his pistols and warning everyone to stay where they are. He is deadly serious and will gun down anyone who makes sudden movements. Ivan plans to take Francis back to the Soviet Union to stand trial for the many laws he has broken and suspiscion of being a spy. He has no knowledge of Nemesis and has nothing but contempt for the superstitious, religious ritual. If given the chance, he will tie up the investigators and then take Francis and Lha-bzang (his ally) in the morning.
                    * The Fallen Seed - In the early morning, everything changes. Along with the bright sun, a halo forms in the sky, though this halo does not surround anything visible, yet. Dorkyev is thunder-struck; he and Francis exchange words in Russian. Ever the pragmatist, Dorkyev frees everyone and begins a descent toward the valley under the halo. Within the valley, the halo light is flat and oily, and its color melts through shades of yellow and green as though through a prism. Lha-bzang vomits and flees. Suddenly, all present feel their hair stand on end as the halo darkens and takes on a dull gun-metal hue. The slight wind disappears and everything is silent. Then, high above a sizzling sound grows in intensity. Suddenly a hideous scream is heard followed by a thunderous blast that knocks everyone off their feet. Everyone suffer partial hearing loss and if a check versus [Body] is completely failed, the loss is permanent. A blinding light rips through the sky and crashes to Earth over the valley ridge that Lha-bzang crossed. A massive explosion rocks the ground and a curtain of flame passes overhead. If not for the ridge, everyone would have been incinerated along with Lha-bzang.
                    * Crater - Peeking over the ridge, a 20 foot crater can be seen with a sickly, green light emanating from it. Wilson frantically says that Eibon's symbol must be placed on the Seed or it will destroy the Earth. Those who have witnessed the Seed in Montana know that any who approach the Seed will die: quickly or slowly. If no one volunteers and no one has a plan, Dorkyev swears, snears of their cowardice, and takes the jewel to the crater. Alas, just as he climbs the crater and is exposed to the light, he screams and immediately melts into a puddle before everyone's horrified sight. Worse, he drops the jewel into the crater. If someone uses a mirror, they can see the jewel near the Seed which is slowly melting the rock around it with its terrible power. Wilson adamantly refuses to go (and will melt if pushed), so someone will have to sacrifice themself or watch the Seed sink into the ground and doom the world.
                    * Eye to Azathoh - The doomed person must resist the corrupting rays, retrieve the jewel, and then touch it to the Seed. Nothing happens for a few moments, then the Seed suddenly shimmers and disappers with a sharp pop. The Seed is gone but a black, marble tunnel lies in its place. The jewel lies on the ground before the tunnel. Hyperborean symbols line the tunnel. This is Eibon's work. When the jewel crosses the threshold, it suddenly reverts to the heavy glowing stone from the Dreamlands. There is a steady breeze down the tunnel and a light can be seen ahead. After 100 meters, a room 250 meter, circular opens up. The room is the exact same shape as the jewel. The breeze has become a howling gale ending in a 5 meter gateway in the center of the other end of the room. The gateway in the center of the oval room gives the impression of an eye looking out into space.
                    * Gateway - The gateway can be reached by a ramp that slopes upward 50 meters. Stars can clearly be seen through the opening, and it is clear that the gate leads directly into outer space. Anyone who has been exposed to the Seed radiance, has an intense desire to go through the gate and join Nemesis. Anyone approaching the gate will need ropes or climbing skill to cling to the reliefs on the floor or be sucked into oblivion. Also, the jewel gains weight as it approaches the gate, as if it is resisting, eventually becoming over 100lbs. If someone can get close or has binoculars, that person will see that the area of space beyond the portal is filled with criss-crossing black lines forming a faint web. Someone may recognize the black substance and The Black associated with Yibb-Tsll. This is Eibon's Web taught to him by Yibb-Tsll. Within the web, an observers intuitively senses that time is slowing to a crawl. Further, the web is creeping through the portal into our world. This is how mad Eibon hoped to save mankind, by freezing us forever in time, so Nemesis can never destroy us.
                    * The End - If the jewel is brought near the gate, in addition to its increased weight, the Black lines start to reach toward the jewel. Simply hurling the jewel through the portal will gather all the webs onto the jewel which breaks the spell of Eibon. If anyone returns to the Stony Desert, they will no longer find Eibon there. The world will no longer be trapped forever in frozen time, but Nemesis will still return some day to end the world, but it will not be today."))))

                * Silas met Julian Baxter in the Congo in 1904 and became friends. In 1919, he met Cynthia Baxter, Julian's niece in the Andaman Islands. In 1920, he came to Providence where he met Phillip and joined the Tuesday Night Academy. Phillip soon after helped him get a teaching position at Brown.
                * Silas practices a form of cannibalism he learned in New Guinea at the instruction of a degenerate Tcho-Tcho priest. The ceremony involves eating the brains of a recently slain primate to gain extended life. This habit made him lose his job at Brown when it was discovered that he was stealing monkey corpse from the lab. He has since made an arrangement with a local undertaker with low moral character, Alvin Beswick. Silas told Beswick that he was performing brain research, but Beswick is just concerned with the money. Beswick allows him access to closed coffin corpses for a price. He was given access to Phillip's corpse and noticed the small bite marks on the scalp. While devouring the brain, Phillip suddenly lurched back to consciousness and thrased wilding before dying. Silas was terrified and is wracked with guilt over his friend's death. He is maintaining his sanity through denial, and if he is forced to confront what he has done, he will retreat inward and become catatonic and need to be institutionalized.
                * Silas is friendly, but he not only knows his role in Phillip's death but is reasonably sure that Cynthia was involved. He is planning to return to the Andaman Islands to investigate Cynthia's activities and also because it is getting hard to hide his youth in Providence.
                * In Sila's desk can be found notes for his next book, about cannibalism. The notes indicate that Silas is unbalanaced. In his files can be found the lease to a farmhouse.
                * Investigating the farmhouse, leads to the table where Phillip met his end. No attempt has been mde to cover up the crime."))))))))

           "* This rare herb is believed to return the dead to life. Actually, it is the tiny worm eggs that grow on the plant that infect the host and turn them into a zombie.
            * Infection - The worms can infect a living host if worms, their eggs, or infected flesh are eaten (even cooking is not a guarantee of safety) or the worms transfer via an ghoul bite. A recently deceased host may also be infected if the eggs are injected directly into the brain.
            * Transformation - Once infected the worms rapidly multiply by division and move through the body. Once fully infected, the worms act as replacement nervous system, stimulating the cells and retarding cell death. The worms stimulate the primitive sections of the brain to cause it to seek more hosts for the worms. The When they first activate the body, its movements are jerky and extreme, but the body quickly adapts and becomes quite agile over time.
            * Pack - The worms are a colony creature and are aware of nearby worms in infected creatures. They, therefore, do not attack other infecteds and tend to collect together in groups.
            * Intelligence Level - Though they are savagely murderous and largely fearless, they do retain an animalistic survival instinct and take shelter and avoid fire and heat which would kill their worms."))

           "* Strengths:
            ** Agility and endurance: In some scenes, they were able to bring down a full-size horse and nearly match the speed of one for short, sustained periods of time.
            ** Short incubation period: It takes about 15 seconds to 1 minute for a victim to turn into an undead zombie. Making them effectively at multiplying and overwhelming urban centres. However, this can vary. One main character was able to resist the infection for over 2 minutes.
            ** Durability: It has been observed that even if their internal organs are exposed or took a direct stab from a sword to their chest, this doesn't kill them.
            ** Heightened sense of smell: A fresh drop of blood from an uninfected human can attract other infected bodies many meters away.
            * Weakness:
            ** Decapitation: They're capable of taking damage that would be fatal to most men. It was found that decapitation or destruction of the head is the most effective in killing them.
            ** Aversion to water bodies: It has been observed they will generally avoid travelling on water bodies. They have no ability to swim, and when they are pushed into deeper waters, they will immediately sink to the bottom.
            ** Heat: They have been observed to immediately seek shelter when the day begins to break in order to escape the heat of direct sunlight. As a result, during spring or summer, they are only active during the day and hibernate at night.
            ** Fire: Fire can be used to keep infected at bay.
            ** Reduced vision: The milky eyes limits their vision to basic movements, so they rely on smell and hearing to hunt.
            ** Blood: Blood can be used to distract or bait the zombies to behave in certain ways. Although dangerous, using fresh blood on rooftops is shown to be an effective means to lure zombies if needed."))))))
