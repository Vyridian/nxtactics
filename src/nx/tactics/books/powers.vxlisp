                * Further, the ripples in space cause space itself to slightly change orientation on each wave. Anything crossing a wave will suffer minor disruption. Light, lasers, radio waves, radiation, and relativistic particles are increasingly scattered as they strike each wave effectively dispersing them.

                * This spatial effect has a number of implications on space travel:
                * High energy radiation becomes unfocused effectively creating radiation shielding proportionate to the distance from the source.
                * Energy weapons, relativistic particle weapons, and railguns become unfocused and scattered effectively increasing the armor of the vessel proportionate to the distance of the weapon.
                * At long distances, the energy detected by radar and other detection devices (even telescopes) become diffused. This effectively provides the vessel with increased stealth proportionate to the distance of the detector.
                * At closer distances, microcircuitry becomes prone to failure and damage. This makes computer chips, the foundation of modern computer science, next to useless.

                * There are a number of distinct advantages to this drive system. Because the ship in not moving, it is not subject to inertia or problems incurred at relativistic speeds.
                * Combat with the Torch drive is unique for several reasons. The occupants are not subject to the enormous stress of maneuvering at relativistic speeds. Conventional weapons have greatly reduced effect because only damage that crosses the interface has any effect on the ship.
                * Weaknesses - The Torch drive must also maintain a protective gravity bubble to defend against its own gravity well. Weapons designed to disrupt the Torch drive have a strong effect by making the ship more vulnerable to damage, by reducing its speed, by subjecting it to increased stress from travelling at relativistic speeds, and by exposing it to its own gravity well."
