 (base/chapter
  :name "High Tech Spacecraft"
  :summary
   "* Interplanetary travel is a common reality in the 23rd century.
    * Types - Spaceships are mostly cargo and ore mining ships, followed by gas tankers.
    * Prismatic Armor - Modern ships have a very thick ablative skin composed of a honeycomb of diamond nano-fibers filled with a highly refractive, radiation and impact absorbing ceramic compound. This armor has a number of beneficial qualities. It deflects energy in random directions which provides radiation resistance, stealth, and energy weapon defense. It fragments and ablates under energy weapon and kinetic impact which shatters incoming	micro-meteors and high speed weaponry and distributes the incoming energy in all directions to prevent penetration. The ablating particles also carry away excess heat in a similar way to evaporation. The resultant particles become a cloud of anti-energy aresol. Any impact strong enough to penetrate the armor will liquify the surrounding armor which quickly solidifies and helps to seal hull breaches.
    * Deflectors - Most long-range ships are equipped with a deflector array. The array is composed of a wide bank of closely spaced ionizing lasers and particle beams. The lasers ionize the particles and form a strong magnetic force down the length of the beam. Small objects headed toward the ship are ionized by the beams and then redirected away by the magnetic field. Point defense lasers are used for larger particles as well as incoming missiles.
    * Propulsion - Propulsion spaceward (outward from the Sun) is often provided by massive Stellasers that reflect and concentrate solar radiation into a 'tight' beam similar to a laser. Ships have depolyable solar sails to capture this energy for propulsion and recharging batteries. These sails can even be used to slowly tack inward. Some cargo ships use particularly large sails to slowly sail the solar wind to reduce costs. Most ships rely on powerful nuclear thrusters for sunward (toward the Sun) travel to accelerate the ship at up to 1g. When possible the ship will accelerate for half the voyage, turn around, and then decelerate for the rest of the trip.
    * Gravity - Except for short periods of weightlessness midway through the trip, the passengers feel gravity during the trip. Up is toward the nose and down is toward the engines. The internal organization of a ship is very similar to a skyscraper. For fuel and reaction mass reasons, the ship may need to travel at slower speeds (and lower gravity) or coast at zero gravity midway through the trip. For this reason, large ships are often equipped with rotating decks to simulate gravity for the crew.
    * Reentry - Spaceships are generally too heavy and not equipped to survive a landing on anything larger than a small moon. Landing on something as massive as the Earth's Moon is possible, but achieving orbit again requires a powerful Laser Lifter system like the one on Luna.

    * Travel Costs
    ** Planet to orbital station skyhooks travel daily and cost 200-300 credits one-way.
    ** Orbital to moon travel twice weekly and cost 600 credits one-way.
    ** Interplanetary trips are like cruises. They travel weekly and cost 20,000-30,000 credits one-way.

    * Safety - Inner ship walls are covered with pillowy-soft panels of 'Space Gel'. This viscous fluid provides a combination of heat insulation, impact padding, radiation shielding, shrapnel absorption, and depressurization protection. Space Gel exposed to freezing temperatures will immediately harden into a very durable solid. If the hull is breached, damaged panels will leak Space Gel. Any gel that touches an area near the breach will instantly freeze, gradually plugging the leak."

     (base/section
      :name "High Mobility Forces"
      :summary
       "* Mobile - The term Mobile, short for High Mobility, was coined to describe forces that emphasized manueverability and terrain use over raw speed, weaponry, or armor.
        ** Mobile Infantry - Human sized battle suits capable of increasing an infantry unit's combat ability. Early versions emphasized weapons and armor, but their high cost and attrition rate moved the focus to fast hit-and-run or blitzkreig style armor.
        ** Mobile Suit - The Mobile Suit is an attempt to create a larger version of Mobile Infantry suits. They remain humanoid and can benefit from infantry tactics on a large scale. The design is a swiss army knife, capable of quickly changing and scavenging weapons and is equally suited for combat and large scale repair operations. The design does have many detractors, however, who argue that the humanoid form is not optimal for ground combat where its height makes it an easy target, air combat where it is not aerodynamic, or space combat where legs have little use.
        ** Mobile Cavalry - Mobile Cavalry is any High Mobility vehicle that is optimized toward its intended enviroment: Mobile Fighters in atmosphere, Mobile Tanks on land, Mobile Subs underwater, Mobile Insects in space, etc. These system are highly specialized in contrast with the general utility of Mobile Suits. Though such designs seem more optimal, there is an argument that Mobile Suit mass production and spare part availability would ultimately win out.
        ** Mobile Armor - The ultimate expression of High Mobility weapons, Mobile Armor are large, heavily armed and armored versions of Mobile Cavalry. They are terrifying monstrosities with similar reputations to the King Tiger tank in World War II. Though on paper, they seem to be the ultimate weapon, in practice their high cost and manufacturing complexity severly limited their deployment and losing even one was devastatingly costly. They can turn the tide of any battle, but were overall less effective than smaller units.
        * Linear Frame - The linear frame is a special harness that mimics the actions of the mobile suit pilot and translates them into mobile suit actions. This gives the mobile suit an uncanny agility and a strangely human grace. A trained pilot can shift the suit's center of gravity to change the armor's orientation without propellent which can substantially increase endurance and survivability.
        * Piloting - A mobile suit pilot wears a special suit and is secured to a linear frame that help manage the incredible g-forces that the mobile suit produces. Rookie pilots have been knocked unconscious or even killed by their own combat maneuvers, so extensive, specialized training is essential. Ace pilots seem almost superhuman in their ability to take physical stress without blacking out.
        * Mobile Suits vs. Capital Ships - Mobile suits have a unique ability against capital ships. They can land anywhere on the surface of the ship (typically outside of firing arcs) and attack components directly. Whenever a mobile suit on a capital ship score [Critical Hits], the player may look at the damage deck and choose the critical instead of choosing one at random.
        * Flight Systems - Spacecraft and Exo-Suits use a ionic plasma drive which ionizes and accelerates gas particles out the exhaust vents at relativistic speeds. These energized particles create a glowing stardust effect at the exhaust ports. These drives also function in atmosphere but their interaction with air creates a massive heat buildup, so they can only be used in short bursts like jump jets. Unusually large vents with heat dispersers can be specially designed for atmosphere, but these are suboptimal in space.
        * Plasma Lance - The lance is a short mobile suit melee weapon. Its firing end is a hollow magnetic tube lined with layers of copper leaf. When held in a specially designed hand or connector, a direct current from the fusion reactor transforms the copper leaf into a short ionizing plasma jet of incompressible copper. The lance appears as an empty weapon hilt until it fires; then it flashes with a brief, blinding jet that violently pierces almost any material it contacts. It is very effective against armor, but its uses are limited so they may only be used a few times before being depleted. Mobile suits will often carry multiple lances, although larger variants exist.

        Land based Mobile Suits follow these principles:
        * Maintain a low profile - Weapons are so destructive that it is much more effective to not be hit. Stay low and use cover at all times. Tracked, Wheeled, Hover and 4 legged vehicles maintain the lowest profile while still being all-terrain.
        * High mobility - Slow, predictable units are sitting ducks. Also, move in 3 dimensions to maximize mobility. This makes legs and jump jets superior to tracks and wheels.
        * Projectile weapons are more effective on the ground than in space - High caliber cannons can be mounted on land vehicles.
        * Land based Mobile Suits developed from dog-like anti-personnel hunter-killer robots. As Electromagnetic Warfare began to defeat digital circuitry, it became necessary to put soldiers back into the war machines and return to larger, more reliable analog systems.

        Space based Mobile Suits follow these principles:
        * Propellent must be expended to accelerate - a modern vehicle in space is more limited by its propellent than its fuel.
        * Arms and Legs are useful - When one part of a mobile suit is moved, it produces a counter-movement in the opposite direction. This effect can be used to adjust the mobile suit's direction without expending propellant. Thus, in zero gravity the mobile suit's arms and legs are not dead weight, but a vital component of its maneuvering system."

           "* The current state-of-the-art space mecha is a wedge-shaped, heavily-armored stealth craft with a turreted particle cannon.
            * Armor Module - The wedge-shaped front, bottom, and sides of the craft are a single hot-swappable module for in combat maintainance. It is primarily composed of ablative, stealth armor. The armor is sharply angled to present the smallest possible angle of penetration and detection from the front.
            * Core Module - The center of the craft is a gyroscopic sphere. The gyroscope is so powerful, it is used for attitude control instead of maneuver jets.
            * Core Drone Module - Like most mobile armors, the Piranha is deployed in large packs (schools) of drones with random human piloted command units. Without a pilot, the core module can contain spare ammo or propellent.
            * Core Pilot Module - The pilot seat is enclosed in this sphere which allows the craft to turn very quickly while rotating the pilot seat separately to minimize angular momentum and G-forces. The escape hatch can be rotated to the top or the bottom of the ship to allow easy exit or connect to ship airlocks.
            * Mission Module - The top and back of the craft contain the weapon systems, propulsion, and fuel in a single hot swappable module. This entire module can be immediately replaced to customize the craft for a mission or rapidly refuel and reload.
            * Space Interceptor Module - The standard space module includes a single heavy particle beam turret and nuclear propulsion (including fuel and reaction mass).
            * Space Bomber Module - This module is identical to the Space Interceptor Modules but replaces the turret with a fixed medium railgun and 2 heavy penetrator nuclear missiles.
            * Orbital Insertion Module - Though rarely used, this module allows the ship to reach orbit from a planet's surface using chemical rockets. The module is also capable of independent re-entry so it can be refueled and reused without the main craft.
            * Atmospheric Interceptor Module - Jet engines and anti-aircraft missiles. With this module, the ship is capable of trans-atmospheric flight. Though its wedge shape is aerodynamic, it provides no lift, so it must rely on its thrust to maneuver and to remain airborne.
            * Atmospheric Bomber Module - Jet engines and precision bombs.
            * Atmospheric Close Support Module - Jet engines and a single heavy penetrator autocannon.
            * Air Cavalry Module - Dual turbine rotor systems and fuel with 2 light rail cannons for rescue and light air support.
            * Land Module - A turret pairing a heavy rail cannon with a high capacity rail machine gun. The rear houses a missile pod housing 6 indirect fire missiles for light bombardment.
            * Marine Module - Marine caterpillar thrust system that allows high speed surface movement or moderate underwater movement with decent stealth.
            * Command Module - Advanced communications and coordiation systems.
            * Sensor Module - Specialized long-range active and passive sensor systems for patroling or spying.
            * Stealth Module - Enhanced stealth system foregoing firepower and performance for stealth. Contains a single medium rail cannon.
            * Science Module - Highly sensitive sensor package for detailed analysis.
            * Service Module - The ship has useful carrying capacity, so besides its combat role, it operates as a repair worker bee and cargo hauler. Typically, repair crews get more flight time on the ship than combat pilots.
            * Cargo Module - A large cargo container and thruster can be afixed to the rear for transport duties.
            * Long Range Module - A variant of the cargo container can be attached to the back of another module to increase the range of the ship providing extra thrust and reaction mass. The module is jettisoned once it reaches its target and is hopefully recovered later.
            * Arms - 6 thin, light-weight arms fold out from under the ship to the front, back, and sides. Each arm has 3 powerful fingers with magnetic clamps and sharp tips that allow the craft to cling to surfaces and walk along them at high speeds like an insect. The arms are strong enough to climb vertical surfaces or be inverted under gravity. The end of each arm has an attitude control jet to aid in high speed manuevers. On land, these jets are replaced with powerful turbines that lets the craft skate across level ground or water. The elbow of each arm is a sphere that can be used as landing gear or wheels on roads or other reasonably flat terrain. 6 arms were chosen, so the craft can still move on 4 arms while carrying or dragging a heavy load with 2. As with insects, 6 arms provides sufficient redundancy in case 1 or even 2 legs are lost to damage. In land combat, the arms allow the craft to maximize cover and peek its gun around corners or over obstacles."

      :summary
       "* The L5 Colonies are enormous space colonies that have been constructed at the five Lagrange points around Earth where gravitational forces are stable. They are 25km to 40km long.
        * Construction - These stations are constructed inside cylinders of Moon rock and asteroids ferried from the Asteroid Belt. The external surface is heavily armored against meteorite impacts. Industrial complexes are mostly on outermost layer of the colonies to keep them away from habitations. Towns are built on the internal surface of the colony. The internal space is divided into zones with large reflective pressure walls that give the appearance of continuous space while limiting the risk of catastrophic failure to any particular zone. Transport tubes are underground and also serve as emergency shelters. In addition to the outer cylinder, there is also an inner cylinder that forms a pressurized, zero-g drydock through the center of the colony.
        * Personnel - Those that have travelled from Earth to the Orbital stations are many of the best and brightest that Earth has to offer. Each colony supports up to 20 million people. Living space is about 300 square km, which is not a lot of room for so many people. Three or four story buildings are the norm, but they cannot be built higher than that because of the Coriolis effect.
        * Resources - Large amounts of solar energy are continuously collected, but life is difficult in space where all materials must be imported (at high tariffs). Orbital industry is generally thriving.
        * Politics - Because the Orbitals are largely corporate run and lack a specific history, they are largely free of geopolitical politics, as well as cultural and racial conflicts. They do, however, retain fierce, corporate politics. Most of all, the Orbitals chafe under the Earth bound regulatory and military agencies that supervise and tax them. Taxes are necessarily high to support so much technology, and taxes are always a point of conflict."

There are not even enough beds for each person, so most people live with people who work different shifts and use the same beds on off-shifts. Common areas are used for everything except sleeping. The Jovians have adapted to be far more social and reliant on others for day to day life. This communal living has generally made them a tight knit society with a strong sense of group identity.
        * Science - Jovian science is one of the most advanced in the solar system. Research and development on ways to make their harsh life safer and more comfortable are always high priorites. Jovian scientists crank out a steady stream of innovations across all disciplines.
        * Military - The military has reaped the rewards of Jovian science and is arguably the most advanced force in the solar system, though certainly nowhere near the largest. Jovian forces are composed of separate standing armies: Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Divisions with Alpha containing the Godsfire flagship. Jovian military theory is based on efficient use of a small number of highly mobile units. They do not fear a large scale assault, since they would receive much forewarning of any attempt to mobilize a large force all the way out to Jupiter. Jupiter's remoteness makes it fairly easy to defend against direct assault, but the harsh environment makes sabotage a much greater threat, so Jovian intelligence forces constantly search for threats.

   "* The year is 2151.

    Things are pretty bad on planet Earth:
    * Global Warming - The build up of smothering greenhouse effect gases has resulted in the complete melting of the Arctic ice cap as well as much of the Antartic ice cap. Coastal areas have been inundated and global temperatures continue to rise, a new record every year.
    * Resource Depletion - As the climate changed, desperate farmers overfarmed their land, increasing erosion and therefore food prices. Fossil fuels became increasingly scarce and given the ongoing climate problems, ecologically unsuitable.
    * Aging Population -
    * Economic Collapse -

    Things are slightly better in space:
    * Orbital Stations - For the last hundred years, large space colonies have been constructed at the five Lagrange points around Earth. Relative to Earth, the Orbital stations are gleaming paradises of corporate efficiency. Corporate interests are certainly strong on the Orbital colonies, and the Orbitals increasingly chafe at Earth's taxation of their goods and the high tariffs on imports.
    * Luna - Huge moon bases dot the lunar surface. With its low gravity and limitless lunar rock, the Moon is the natural construction center for most Orbital facilities and spaceships. Surface and underground mining operations go around the clock. Enormous massdrivers propel the material into Earth orbit.
    * Mercury - Solar stations on Mercury provide limitless power while the molten surface provides limitless ore. Though the surface is hellish and survival is difficult, Mercury provides wealth beyond imagining to those able to survive. The population is 90% male with most residents on a 6 year work contract. After the contract they usually return to wherever they came from with enough money to buy a house and start a family. Like a military veteran, Mercury companies also offer generous benefits for the rest of the contractor's life or generous death benefits to their family if they don't survive. Despite extensive safety systems, the fatatlity rate remains 1 in 20 even among these hardy folk. Politically, Mercury is extremely independent and has little patience for the affairs of the other planets.
    * Venus
    * Mars
    * Asteroid Belt - Though Luna provides a steady supply of material to the colonies, whole Asteroids can be ferried from the Asteroid Belt to create instant colonies. Further, the valuable minerals in an asteroid are easier to detect and mine than in either Lunar or Terrestrial mines. The Asteroid field is large, however, so a whole crop of freelance prospectors have travelled to the Asteroid Belt in a high-tech gold-rush.

If they choose to capture the Eidolon, a hurried scramble as a self-destruct timer counts down and bulkheads slam shut is just as exciting as an action-packed firefight in the command center. Agents and reporters are harder to integrate with the destruction of the station, but are more easily involved in the discovery process.")

           "* Summary - After the discovery and decomissioning of the secret Venusian research station, the Jovian government found some advanced mech prototypes that the Venusians had been testing in the Jovian atmosphere. This led to the Agora paying more attention to a request of assylum from one Dr. Peyarje, and sent the PCs to help retrieve him.

            * Dr. Peyarje - UEA has conscripted the brilliant Dr. Peyarje into their service, forcing him to develop next generation exo-weapons at a hidden base. In the interests of keeping an appearance of openness, they have allowed Peyarje to attend the 2210  Intersettlement Scientific Convention (ISC), though he is accompanied by a detachment of the UEA military. He has managed to get a plea for help and request for asylum to the Jovian embassy. His crowning achievement is a telepathic mech control system based on discoveries found from the Floaters over Jupiter.

            * Georgia On My Mind - The players have been dispatched to extract Peyarje from the ISC conference in Venus orbit. They are hidden among the large Jovian delegation to the ISC aboard the Georgia On My Mind space liner. However, in order to smuggle them aboard, they can carry now weapons or equipment and will need an alternate means of escape.

            * Stanton Station - A space station in Venus Orbit where the Internation Scientific Convention (ISC) is being held. Here, Peyarje will be allowed to present a carefully censored summary of his work on cyberlinkage technologies. The players should take part in the early stages of the ISC while they investigate the conference and find a way to get Peyarje away from his UEA handlers and off-station.

            * Jovians - The Jovians wish to reap the PR benefits to be found in rescuing a brilliant, pacifist scientist from UEA’s militaristic clutches and also hope that Peyarje can shed some light on some samples of his CAT/Rapid-Scan system found on a secret research station.

            * UEA - Unfortunately for these operatives, the UEA is taking the security of their prisoner very seriously. The third division of the UEA 4th fleet are moored just off Stanton, at the invitation of the Venusian Plantary Council, and permission has been granted for several officers and marines to accompany Peyarje as a security detail. Though the ISC filed a formal protest over the admittance of UEA military officers acting in an official capacity, the issue has since been dismissed and other nations have been allowed to included similarly-limited security details for their detachments.

            * Beautiful Dreamer - The PC's meet their contact, Ysa Cantroini and through her, Aglaee Dessources. Both seem to be independents commissioned by the Jovians. Ysa is surpisingly competent at many abilities and Aglaee has a ship for escape along with the  characters' gear and mechs.

            * CHARACTER INVOLVEMENT
            JAF pilots could be members of an official JAF escort, added (as mentioned above) to balance out the UEA military forces escorting Dr. Peyarje. The pilots would still be instructed to ask questions and discretely investigate, but would be intended to act as a decoy and backup for the real extraction team. By asking questions and poking their noses into places they don’t belong, they would be expected to draw attention away from the real JIS operatives. Who could, in turn, be exposed and captured at the last minute, forcing the players to pull off the heist on their own with insufficient planning.

            The players could be the backup JIS team instead of the primary, tasked with investigating and doing footwork for the primary team. This puts them on the front lines, while the primary team works to solidify their own cover. The primary team’s cover could then be blown, forcing the players to execute the operation, and keeping them on the front lines. This has many hooks for complications and intruigue. What if the compromised team wasn’t discovered, but betrayed by a double agent in their own ranks? This goes well with the scene (see below) that has the players trapped in hiding on Stanton. What if the Venusians (specifically, Malachai) were aware of the operation all along and either want the operatives to expose themselves or for the operation to succeed/fail for reasons of their own?

            Reporters have the easiest time finding cover identities - they don’t need them. The ISC is a big deal, and reporters from all over the solar system can be expected to attend. And reporters are expected to be nosy, so no-one’s going to take excessive notice of a few asking questions where they shouldn’t. However, due to their typical lack of combat skills, reporters will probably be harder to handle for the actual freeing of Peyarje. They would probably have to resort to subterfuge and trickery if called upon to get Peyarje away from his guards themselves. One possibility is to have JIS agents already in place on Stanton handle the snatch, then pass Peyarje off to the reporters for transport, as in the JAF pilots write-up above.

            The 3rd Division of the CEGA 4th fleet is composed of:
            * 2 Tengu carriers with extra vehicle bays.
            * 4 Bricru corvettes.
            * 1 Hachiman destroyer.

            One Tengu carries a Wyvern and three Wraiths, while the other carries four Syreens. The squadron is accompanied by several fuel ships, to give extra range to the short-legged CEGA warships. Garand’s Wyvern is the Command variant. While the Hachiman is technically the flagship of the squadron, Garand usually commands from aboard his Tengu where he has easy access to his exo-armor. This can be used to involve Kleb in the scene without Garand's knowledge - Kleb could be travelling aboard the Hachiman, watching and ready to take command should the situation demand it.

            * Escape - The 3rd Divison lacks is deployed far from reinforcements, so it will act cautiously. They know that they don’t need to kill the players - they need to capture the Dreamer. The PCs should realize this, and be careful not to let themselves be drawn away... For what seems like a retreat could really be an attempt to lure them away so that another force can slip in and disable the Dreamer’s engines.")

           "* Beautiful Dreamer - Rescued from his UEA handlers at the Intersettlement Scientific Convention, Dr. Peyarje and his rescuers have fled Venus aboard the Beautiful Dreamer, privateer ship commanded by Aglaee DesSources. Unfortunately, they have not lost the UEA forces seeking to recapture Peyarje. The 3rd Division of the UEA 4th fleet, commanded by ace pilot Ranho Garand, is in hot pursuit.

            * Intercept Course - DesSources’ skillful helmsmanship makes the most of their limited reaction mass, but Garand’s 3rd Division is slowly closing in, blocking the orbits they could use to travel out-system. Garand's fleet makes a high energy burn and manages to intercept them and another heated battle ensues. After the battle, the UEA force, having used their remaining reaction mass to intercept must wait for a fuel tender to continue the pursuit.

            * The Long Trip to Earth - Low on fuel, with the UEA pursuit fleet closing in fast, the crew of the Beautiful Dreamer find themselves with only one option: change course and head for the Earth system, the heart of the UEA and the only source of supplies and fuel in range. Perhaps they can loose their pursuers in the high-traffic Orbitals and find another way to Jupiter. Because reaction mass is low and they need to run silent, the trip takes many days at zero-g. Many days in radio silence are spent discussing ways to get out of this mess.")

           "* Ismael Li - Fortunately, the Jovians have been working hard to save the mission and have made a deal with a burgeoning rebel group on the Moon which can to provide them with the fuel and parts they need... For a price!

            * The Eagle has Landed - Now they just need to avoid the blockade and land on the Moon. Though the Moon has very low gravity, the Beautiful Dreamer is not designed to land on a Moon. Even if they survive the landing, they may not be able to take off again. However, there is no choice in the matter. After a harrowing landing, the rebels help bury the Dreamer in lunar dust and begin repairs and refueling.

            * Copernicus Base - The characters are invited to the underground, domed city known as Coperinus Base. Here the charismatic Ismael Li introduces them to the harsh life of the Lunar miners. There is nothing to do but wait and meet the pleasant locals while the ship is repaired and the UEA prepares its next move.

            * The Plot Thickens - Gradually, Ismael brings the characters to see supporters and see his gear. Ismael intends to lead a rebellion to take over Copernicus Base and he needs the characters' help. His group lacks seasoned fighters and they lack tactics, organization, and strategy. This revelation sparks a heated debate over the wisdom of this endevour. No one can argue that their situation is difficult, but even if they succeed the Lunar Authority and the UEA will not just sit back and allow a rebellion. Ismael argues that once they seize control, the Lunar Authority will have to negotiate. Others fear a strong, military response. Any armed conflict in a space station is loaded with risk. If one of the characters befriends or falls in love with one of the rebels, it would add a more personal edge to the rebellion.

            * Eleventh Hour - With or without the characters' help, Ismael begins to grease the wheels of revolution through raids, assassinations, sabotage, and public relations campaigns. Their target is Captain Ansevik the head of Copernicus security. If they can capture her, they believe they can secure the base.

            * Moon Strike - After providing the characters with the repairs and fuel they need, he launches his armed uprising in the depths of Copernicus hoping to drag them into the fight. Moving barricades outwards at carefully-regulated intervals, his troops and exo-suits advance through the dome, driving out the UEA bureaucrats and policemen as they go. The few initial firefights go well for the rebels.

            * The Tide Turns - About six hours into the fighting, things begin to turn. Ansevik manages to get her exo-suit forces into Copernicus, and their numbers mean bad things for the rebels.

            * Evacuation - Catherine Glit starts an evacuation of refugees. The rebels lift as many to hastily-contracted merchant and passenger ships in lunar orbit as they can. Things become even more chaotic as the Selenties abandon their posts and the rebels fall back before the UEA forces. Organizing such a retreat is no easy task. Dessources takes as many refugees as possible aboard the Dreamer. Ysa wants to help the rebels fight. The characters should be involved in the fighting or evacuation effort somehow. After all, it was their presence that provided the catalyst that started the rebellion.

            * Escape - Her holds crammed with refugees and UAE ships starting to move in, Aglaee orders the characters back to the ship. Greatful for their help, Li lets them go. He sends Catherine Glit with them at the last minute, against her wishes. As the characters head for the  spaceport, the rebels begin another counter-attack, slowly forcing the UAE ground troops back and taking the spaceport and ground-to-orbit weapons. The citizens who couldn’t be evacuated riot, pelting helpless UEA infantry and marines with rocks and bricks. Things are obviously not going well for the UEA troops.

            * Copernicus Dome Disaster - Ansevik realizes that the rebels could use the city's ground-to-orbit weapons to attack his warships. He must now choose whether to withdraw or fire on the defensive batteries. In a panic, Ansevik orders his ships to attack the laser and missile batteries. The resulting explosions are far larger than expected and shatter the dome. A hasty retreat ensues as the Dome opens to vacuum, killing rebel, civilian, and UEA marine alike.

            * Chaos -  Ismael Li operates the Laser Lifter to boost the refugee ships away, including the Dreamer. Li's last words, relayed to his friends and helpers aboard the Dreamer, are My life for freedom! The Dreamer attempts to escape with the other refugee ships, but the UEA ships are positioned to easily stop them. The UEA demands their surrender, but the UEA ships are then ordered to focus on rescue instead of pursuing the refugee ships.

            * Aftermath - In the end, thousands are killed in Copernicus Dome. The UEA, of course, refuses to take the blame for the Dome disaster. Their first desperate response is to put the blame on the Jovian terrorists who abducted Peyarje. Reporters use Ansevik's actions as fodder for their own counter-attack against UEA's propaganda.

            * Notes - Develop the rebellion and the rebels, especially Ismael Li. Emphasize the moon's restrained and industrious culture and the rampant poverty and utilitarian nature of the underground cities. If appropriate, show the corruption of the UEA officials that oversee the colonies. Play up the initial hope and final despair of the rebels, the desperation of the refugees to find a better life, and the chaos of close-quarters fighting in the Lunar warrens.")

           "* Mission to Mars - The UEA is in pursuit again and logically expects the Dreamer to head to Jupiter. However, with its high speed escape and her holds crammed with refugees, there's no way for the Beautiful Dreamer to make Jupiter without running out of supplies or fuel. Fortunately for her crew and desperate passengers, the ship can easily make Mars. There, Aglaee DesSources hopes that the Martian Republic will be able to provide homes to the refugees.

            * Decoy - The UEA pursuit will soon catch up and they cannot be allowed to follow the Dreamer to Mars, so a desperate plan is devised. The booster rockets from the Moon are removed and fitted with decoy gear to make the rockets appear as the Dreamer. The pilots will escort the rockets on the current course while the Dreamer makes a course correction and silently coasts towards Mars. The escort will engage enemy mechs drawing out the enemies resources while maintaining the charade as long as possible. Once the decoy is discovered the pilots must return to the rockets and activate the massive rockets to boost away at high speed to rendevous with the Dreamer. This plan is loaded with risk and the pilots will probably be caught or killed. Their farewell is long and emotional. After the Moon, the pursuit fleet commander has been ordered to kill everyone aboard the Dreamer both in revenge and to eliminate witnesses. When the UEA pursuit fleet catches up to the decoy, a heated fight begins with no quarter given. Because the UEA is out for blood, they focus on the pilots instead of the 'Dreamer'. The pilots are driven back and the ruse is discovered. The pilots must make a desperate dash to the booster and escape before they are blown out of the sky. Fortunately, they escape though with heavy losses and damage and rendevous with the Dreamer on schedule. The UEA fleet has overcommitted to Jupiter and are unable to pursue to Mars. Anxious days pass as the Dreamer travels at full speed to Mars. When they arrive they will have to hope that the Martian government doesn't arrest them on the spot. Meanwhile, Garand has deduced that the refugees will divert the Dreamer to Mars (because that's what he would do), but his disgust with his superiors' handling of the battle on the Moon causes him to go to Mars on his own.

            * Mars Arrival - The Dreamer enters Mars orbit and is immediately escorted by a fighter wing and two destroyers. The escort demands that the Dreamer stand down all weapons and prepare to be boarded. They have little choice in the matter. There is nowhere else to go. The boarding party secures the engine room and bridge and dock the Dreamer at the massive Orbital Elevator space station called Heaven. All passengers are taken to immigration while their ship is searched. Here they meet Yanna Summers, the chief adminstrator of the Elevator. Little information is forthcoming and all senior staff are to be taken by shuttle to Mars Federation police headquarters. As they descend, they get an amazing view of the incredible Orbital Elevator in action.

            * Stairway to Heaven - Constructed with the aid of Venus Bank, the Martian Orbital Elevator, Stairway to Heaven is a marvel of engineering. It stretches upwards from its base at Hell Station just north of the Federation capital of Kurtzenheim to the Heaven Station counterweight. The elevator is dominates the landscape and has become a symbol of Mars Federation authority. It shines like a moon day or night, and it catches the first light of day every sunrise before the rest of Mars. Its ore containers crawl up and down the tether 24 hours a day. The current chief adminstrator, Yanna Summers, is extremely organized and professional and keeps very tight ship.

            * Martian Politics - Since its creation, the Orbital Elevator has become the center of Martian politics. Mars has two major political factions: the Mars Federation and the Free Republic of Mars. The Mars Federation is an authoritarian regime. It controls most of Mars and is loosely allied with the UEA. The Free Republic of Mars is smaller and is largely at odds with everything the Federation does. The Orbital Elevator has become the center of Martian debate because the Federation controls the Elevator and the huge profits it produces will allow the Federation to dominate the Free Republic in just a few years. Open conflict on Mars has become common and numerous terrorist organizations perform increasingly savage raids on the Mars Federation. The Federation in turn blames the Republic of backing the terrorists which is not entirely without merit.

            * Life on Mars - At police headquarters, they must negotiate for asylum for the refugees and avoid arrest and extridition to the UEA. They meet with Paul Treben of the Solar Police who is surprised to learn of the unofficial version of the events on the Moon. He will report everything he learns to his superiors who will in turn secretly inform the UEA.  Representatives from both political factions arrive intending to use the characters to their own ends. The Mars Federation wants to extridite the characters as terrorists, but the Free Republic grants the refugees asylum and puts a hold on the extridition of the crew of the Dreamer.

            * Waiting Around - Support for the UEA is weak here, so the characters are released for the time being, though they are escorted by an armed detail at all times. Garand and his elite unit are also poking around and soon confronts the high profile characters, but he has no authority on Mars and can do nothing while the characters remain. In the meantime, the refugees are brought to the Free Republic and a media circus begins as their stories hit the airwaves. The public is shocked and sympathetic to the Selenites, but this soon turns to rage as it becomes clear that the same thing could happen to them. The normal protests for fair use of the Orbital Elevator break out into massive riots and terrorist activity spikes across Mars.

            * Dangerous Liason - Though the govenments seems to treat the characters like criminals, the public treats them like celebrities or even heroes. While out and about, a pretty young woman approaches one of the males and gushes about how wonderful he is and leaves him her contact code on a slip of paper. After further inspection, the contact code is not a personal address but a secure web site. Following the link, they speak with the girl, Lydia Ketchum, but her manner is very different. She is a political radical who has been implicated in terrorist activity including attacks on police and bombings. She is proud of her actions and believes that giving her life for a free Mars would be a fair trade. She proposes a daring escape plan. Her people will help smuggle the characters up the elevator in a depressurize ore car. There they must fight their way through the station, take over the administration headquarters, and release their ship and mechs from impound. Her people can then use the station defenses to cover their escape. With the station under her control, she can negotiate fair use of the elevator going forward from a position of strength.

            * Departure - Lydia's plan does not sound entirely rational, and she is not the sort of person who can be trusted. However, without allies the characters are never going to escape Mars, so they have no choice but to take a chance regardless of the consequences. Catherine and Ibrahim are unsure of their long-term safety on Mars and decide to join the group to continue all the way to Jupiter despite the risks.

            * Hell Ride - After days of planning, Lydia's people distract the guards and the characters make a run for it. After they make their escape, they are swiftly taken to an ore processing plant and smuggled aboard an ore train car. In the train are guns, pressure suits, Lydia, and four of her people. The train goes to Hell station where the cars are searched. Tense moments pass as they wait for the inspector to get to their car. When he opens the car, he looks right at them, winks at Lydia, waves his scanner, and lets the car pass. The characters must take care not to be crushed when the train contents are dumped into an elevator crawler. Soon, the crawler begins its long, slow trip up the elevator.

            * Heaven Sent - When the elevator arrives at Heaven, its contents are dumped into an open bin. More of Lydia's sympathizers help them bypass security forces. Now the characters need to get to Heaven's Command Center with as little bloodshed as possible. Complicating the situation, Garand appears on a screen. He and his men have commendeered an elevator crawler and are on their way up with their mechs. Though Heaven is a huge structure, it is not a military installation, so with the help of sympathizers, getting to the Command Center is surprisingly easy. Yanna is enraged, but her actions are always pragmatic, so she surrenders the Command Center when the odds are stacked against her.

            * Elevator Falls - Once Command is secured, the way to the Dreamer is open. Lydia says she will cover their escape and then begin negotiations with the govenment for release of the station. She is, of course, lying. After the Dreamer departs, she does help the Dreamer escape by threatening the UEA ships who cannot fire on the station, but once the Dreamer is clear, she turns Heaven's weapons on the tether. As the support is destroyed, Heaven begins spinning out of orbit while the elevator cable begins to fall, slowly at first, then faster and faster. Garand uses his mech to punch free of the doomed elevator, but he is a very low orbit. The damage from the cable's impact is incredible, as the white-hot dimond-fiber cable slams into the red dust at several times the speed of sound. The elevator is more than one and a half the length of the planet's equator and slowly wraps itself around Mars destroying everything around it for miles. The impact raises a massive cloud of dust and leaves a huge canyon visible from space. The destruction is unequalled in the history of mankind. The death toll is in the millions. The UEA must rescue Garand and Heaven station, so the Dreamer crew can begin the sad trip to Jupiter.")

           "* Epilogue - The Heaven crew is rescued from a harrowing tumble into space, but the station spins off into space. Lydia proudly takes full credit for the assault in the name of a free Mars. There is little doubt that Lydia will be tried and executed which seemed to be her plan from the start. Her testimony makes it seem that she duped the Dreamer crew into fighting her battle for her. There are many, however, who draw a connection between the Dreamer crew and the disasters on the Moon and Mars. They are not officially terrorists, but you wouldn't know it from some of the news stations. The elevator disaster almost exclusively harmed the Mars Federation which shifted the balance of power back toward the Free Republic, which was Lydia's intention. Garand was saved by a daring low-orbit rescue. The UEA uses his story and the elevator fall to try to deflect attention from their crimes on the Moon, but the UN determines that the Copernicus Disaster was an act of state oppression and that the UEA should be subjected to sactions.

            * Jupiter - With fresh supplies and full fuel tanks, the Dreamer is easily able to make Jupiter. There, Dr. Peyarje transfers to the JAW Skunk Works team on Joshua Station. His new thought control system is refitted into the new Prometheus prototype mech.

            * A Mad Plan - The UEA leadership assesses their situation are are not happy at all. They invested massive resources developing Dr. Peyarje's mech control system to gain the upper hand, but now that technology will shift military power toward the Jovians instead. Their actions have caused the Selenites to openly hate and fear them. The Martian economy is in ruins with their ally the Mars Federation hit hardest. The Venusian Bank is still behind them, but they won't be if UEA influence collapses. The military proposes a heartless plan: destroy the Jovian colonies now before the new technology can be used and the entire Solar System will fall under UEA control. The Venusians can be bought off. The disasters on the Moon and Mars leave them in no position to fight back. The other colonies are too small and will have to fall in line. All of this chaos has created an opportunity to establish a new order, but the time to act is now.

            * The Hammer Falls - The 4th Fleet, still assigned to recover Peyarje and waiting just outside of Jovian space, is ordered into action. The Elysee Station sensor net has been disabled by a UEA agent, allowing the fleet to close with the colony undetected. A powerful jamming device has been deployed by the fleet to prevent the station from calling for help. The ships and mechs are ordered to attack Joshua Station to disable their defenses and force them to negotiate the extradition of the 'terrorists'. Unknown to them, their attack is a diversion for an elite squad of marines in exo-suits who will use retro-rocket packs to deorbit Elysee Station. Their real plan is to send the capital colony and all its inhabitants plunging into the Jovian atmosphere within twenty-four hours. With its leaders and their central hub gone, the Jovians will fall under UEA control.

            * Dragonstriker - On Joshua station, the characters are introduced to the new elite Vindicator mechs as well as the prototype Prometheus. Each have been fitted with the new CAT control system, but have yet to be tested. Suddenly advanced warning alarms sound, the station is under attack! Ranho Garand's team of elite mechs are charging toward the station, his massive Dragonstriker armor slicing through the Jovian defenses. His intense will and discipline give him near-perfect control over the still imperfect control system fitted to the prototype Dragonstriker. The characters launch to meet him, and the Dreamer hastily launches to lend support to the defending destroyers. All long range communications are disrupted by jammers, so a courier ship is sent to warn the other colonies. The battle is intense, but before it can be resolved, the courier returns. The pilot, Carl DeMers, broadcasts a warning when the interference clears: there is another larger force that has attacked Elysee station! They have fixed rocket packs to the hull and are decelerating the entire colony out of orbit! Everyone at Elysee will die when the station breaks up in Jupiter's atmosphere.

            * Taking Sides - Kleb's total lack of honor have pushed Garand's loyalties to the breaking point. If he finds out about the true plan for Elysee, he will turn on Kleb's fleet. This will cause other fleet elements loyal to Garand to turn or withdraw from combat. The mechs board their ships are are quickly, re-outfitted on the short trip to Elysee.

            * The God and the Dragon - They arrive at Elysee to find the battle in full swing, with the Jovian forces slowly being driven back by the UEA Fleet, and the retro-rockets are just beginning to fire. The JSS Godsfire, its weapon block mauled by enemy fire, is trying to evacuate as many civillians as it can, using its remaining firepower to keep the UEA exos and fighters at a distance. Two teams are deployed: one to fight the UEA special forces and disable the rockets, and the another to battle the UEA fleet. The arrival of the Prometheus and Dragonstriker, and a detachment of other exo-armors, quickly turns the tide of battle. The battle seems unlikely to be resolved soon, thanks to the power of Kleb's Posideon flagship. Garand confronts his former boss, and flies straight toward the Posideon. The Dragonstriker is heavily damaged by the fire, but manages to clamp unto the Posideon's bridge and opens fire at point blank range. The Dragonstriker and Posideon go up in a massive explosion, damaging nearby ships. The tide of battle suddenly turns. Many UEA soldiers were unhappy with Admiral Kleb's actions and are easy to convince with impassioned plees. The rockets are disabled and Elysee station uses its engines to regain its correct orbit.

            * Epilogue: Garand - Of Garand, no remains are found. While he could have escaped in the escape pod, it seems unlikely that he survived. That the CSS Karana, an Uller-class missile cruiser believed destroyed during the battle, is missing is noticed during cleanup months later, but no connection is ever made between the two events. Garand did survive, but was horribly wounded, and was recovered later by the crew of the Karana, who had trained under him.

            * Epilogue: UEA - Kleb was killed in the destruction of the Scylla's bridge. The UEA government publically him off as a 'lone gunman' who acted without official sanction and engages in a ruthless purge of the Navy's command structure to 'remove any who might seek to follow Admiral Kleb's example'. In fact, they use this to eliminate to expunge or marginalize those taught by Garand or 'corrupted' by his philosophy from the upper ranks. Their shadowy ties to Venus remain as strong as ever, and, much to their relief, the diplomatic repercussions of the Odyssey affair fade away over the next year.

            * Epilogue: Venus - Malachai falls into disgrace with VenusBank for his failure to produce results or protect the existance of Project Methuselah, and becomes a dissatisfied freelancer. For the next decade he wanders the solar system, hatching mad schemes to put him in the good graces of his former employer once more and destroy the Confederation. He is eventually captured by SolaPol and disappears. VenusBank begins scaling back its operations slightly, uncertain of just how much the Confederation knows. No public or private charges are ever made by the Confederation over the poaching of the Floaters or the aims of Project Methuselah, leaving the Bank executives in a very unpleasant information vacuum.

            * Epilogue: Mars - The consequences of the Martian Elevator take a long time to show themselves. Initially, neither Martian government accuses the other of the collapse. Evidence is sketchy, and the presence of Jovian and UEA agents on-site makes things even more uneasy.")))

       "* The Flashlight Project - Blocked from what they believed to be their rightful control over the colonies at every turn by the Jovian Confederation, UEA launched several top-secret advanced weapons projects.  One of the less successful efforts was the Flashlight Project, an attempt to develop heavy autonomous drone combat spacecraft. The two Lucifer prototypes, the ultimate end result of the project, were ideal for commerce raiding. They could operate for years without more than cursory communication with their home base; their stealth systems could hide them from the most determined sensors; and their heavy array of particle beam weapons could savage a warship in a single volley.
        * The project turned out to be too complicated and expensive to mass-produce, but the prototype was dispatched to Jovian space for 'field trials', with orders to destroy any target with a Jovian registry it came across. The plan was to disrupt the Jovian economy enough to make them more pliable to UEA demands.
        * After the Battle of Elysee, the UEA council determined that the Lucifer would be a political hand grenade if it was captured. They ordered the Lucifer to self destruct, but it had already disappeared in the radiation and magnetic fields around Jupiter, the very fields they had relied upon to hide the drone as it went about its work. Finally, the crew managed to get a signal through, but some interference caused the drone to change course and crash on Europa instead of self-destructing."

           "* The UEA Black Eagle Squadron is smuggled aboard the freighter Narsus to recover the datacore of the Lucifer and destroy any evidence. The Black Eagles had planned to slip onto Europa undetected after the Narsus dropped into orbit around the moon. Supposedly, she was to be taking on water for a journey up to Ganymede. The plan was that she would deploy the Eagles’ exo-armors, head off to deliver the rest of her cargo, then return and pick them up a week later. Faulty parts led to an explosion in Narsus' engines during her insertion burn. The captain managed to drop the freighter into a stable orbit around Europa before the engines completely died, but then, as is standard practice for merchant crews, immediately set off a distress beacon.
            * With all the unexplained attacks in Jovian space lately, an exo-armor patrol is dispatched from their carrier to investigate. The crew seems to sincerely have severe engine trouble. Some of the Jovians will have to board the Narsus leaving their exos tethered to the hull. The remainder stay on patrol.
            * Inside, the freighter is in zero-g and is particularly cramped. The crew's story seems to hold up, but the four passengers are uneasy about the situation. The engines are in bad shape and are irradiated. The cargo hold has large, sealed, liquid cargo bins labeled with warnings as liquid methane. If the Jovians start attempt to open the cargo, the captain will lose his nerve and reveal that the passengers are UEA pilots. A firefight erupts and the Black Eagles get into the cargo containers and remotely open the cargo bay to vacuum. The UEA troops escape by detonating the Narsus as a distraction (killing the crew, of course) and releasing an ECM scrambler pod. They have clearly descended to Europa somewhere.")

Suddenly, from under the ice, an impossibly brilliant beam of light lances up to engulf one of the descending exo-armors. It doesn't explode but it just melts and disappears in the beam. Soon, the ice seems to explode and the enormous black form of the Lucifer rises from below.
            * With its data core removed and a firefight nearby, it switched to its limited, secondary systems and it is unable to determine friend from foe.

Without its higher brain functions, the Lucifer is more of a killing machine than an assassin, so it is now a question of how much damage it will do before it is taken down.
            * If the Lucifer is destroyed over Europa, it will crash into the ice and be lost in the depths. Without their pickup, the UEA agents will have to negotiate the terms of their surrender. Regardless, they will be tried and interrogated for their actions.")))

With a capacity of 6 mobile suits and a battery of bow-mounted mega particle guns, the Zanzibar was often used as the command ship for smaller fleets when a Gwazine class battleship was either unavailable or unsuitable. Lacking the Pegasus class' integral Minovsky Craft System, the Zanzibar could only operate for short periods in Earth's atmosphere, using sustained thrust. When being launched back into space, the Zanzibar class required a special rocket booster to supply the necessary thrust to break free of Earth's gravity.
            Like most Zeon warships of the One Year War, lacked launch catapults, instead deploying its complement of mobile suits through a simple hatch on the ventral hull."

            Although closely based on the GM II, was far better in performance in terms of generator power, thruster acceleration and maneuverability. To help keep its cost down, the Nemo used many weapons already employed by other existing mobile suits, such as the RMS-099 Rick Dias' beam saber and the GM II's beam rifle."

The Rick Dias should originally be called Gundam Gamma because it is built out of new Gundarium Gamma. This material was developed by Axis and it makes the suit lighter and thus makes it able to accommodate greater fuel capacity."

Its forearms also mounted large-bladed beam swords, and could be detached and directed at targets via a cable connection and through the control of the Psyco Gundam Mark II's psycommu system, giving the unit an all-range attack capability quite similar to that of the Principality of Zeon's MSN-02 Zeong. The Psyco Gundam Mark II also carried a set of 'reflector bits,' which were unarmed but used to redirect its own beam weapons fire to targets that are out-of-sight, or to deflect incoming enemy beam weapons fire."
