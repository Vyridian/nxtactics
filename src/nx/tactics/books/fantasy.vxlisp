His brilliance and magical aptitude were soon recognized and he was accepted into the academy. For the next 25 years he completed his full wizardry and elemental training and received top honors.

Galamir recruited Phirax to join him to perform the more dangerous and mundane tasks while Galamir provided the leadership and strategy. Later, he recruited the Warrior Stam and the Cleric Sarak into their party to rounded out their abilities."

He appreciates plans and planners, but he feels that plans must always be flexible because they rarely predict a situation accurately.
            * Beliefs - Phirax believes that improving the lives of those around him will also improves his own life. He sees this as selfishness through selflessness, therefore it is always in his own interest to help others. He could easily manipulate those around him, but he abhors the idea of exploiting others and is quick to judge abusers of any kind. He follows the lesser god Seker on his mission to destroy undead, specifically those who feed on or otherwise exploit the living (which is pretty much all of them).
            * History - Phirax was born into a large family on a farm bordering the Arden Forest. During the day, he learned diverse combat and survival skills with the Elves of the forest. At night he practiced various social skills at the human tavern. He was planning to set out on his own soon when he encountered a rather awkward and self-important Wizard named Galamir. After he confirmed the Wizard's abilities, he agreed to join him as a pair of traveling adventurers. Soon after, the pair teamed up with a Warrior and a Cleric. With the party complete, they set out for danger and treasure."

                * Fiaqua means 'The Flower on the Water'. It is named that way because of the beautiful flowers that naturally grow all over the surface of the city as well as for the Black Lotus trade that was the reason for the city's founding. Fiaqua is unofficially known as the 'City of Knives' because of the strong criminal element and rampant assassinations. It is not so much a city as a series of shacks built on planks and pontoons that extend from a sandbar in the [Serpentine River] into the surrounding swamps.
                * Geography - Fiaqua is a tiny city located a half mile inland on the [Serpentine River] in the country of [Tunis].
                * Politics - Fiaqua is currently ruled by Queen Amelia Tremont, a minor crimelord who fancies herself a queen. She assassinated her predecessor and has proven quite adept at maintaining a delicate balance between her criminal compatriots, the [Naga], and the neighboring nations that have made the Lotus trade illegal but tolerate it as long as it doesn't create a disruption.
                * History - Fiaqua was founded two hundred years ago when the [Black Lotus] flower was discovered there. Initially, only a small band of criminals harvested the Lotus, but their actions attracted the local [Naga] who owned the land. Conflicts continued for many years until a truce was established where the [Naga] cultivated the flower and the humans sold it. This arrangement has worked for over 150 years despite some rather dramatic conflicts.
                * Law - Few things are illegal in Fiaqua. Fewer still are enforced. Since Fiaqua is a criminal haven created for the express purpose of smuggling, criminal types are widely accepted. The local [Naga] serve as enforcers to keep the peace while also controlling the population of homeless and hopelessly drug addicted. It is widely known that one must not venture out alone at night. Besides the Black Lotus trade, Fiaqua also runs very successful gambling dens and brothels catering both to the wealthy elite and to the desperate.
                * Visitors - The drug trade attracts addicts and experimenters because of the Lotus' legal status in Fiaqua as well as the large sums that can be gained through smuggling. The wealthy are often attracted to the 'anything for a buck' nature of the city as well as the surprising safety (as long as you have personal bodyguards). Traders come to the city because its position in the swamp requires it to import most of its essentials including the very lumber that makes up the city. Prices are fairly cheap, but unfortunately service is terribly slow because of the rampant drug addiction.
                * Wildlife - The city is covered with blossoming flowers all the time. These bloom from creeping vines that help hold the decaying wooden structures together.

            * Settlements - There are a handful of small towns composed of exiles and shipwreck survivors carving out a meager living from the hostile land. Agriculture is difficult, but ironically hunting is good for those who can avoid becoming the hunted themselves.
            * Ruins - Though there are no native people on Wraeclast, there is ample evidence of early advanced cultures, apparently predating the evil influences that currently makes civilization so challenging. Many speculate that this previous civilization was destroyed when they unleashed the curse that still devastates the land.")))

                           * The Colossus was constructed to celebrate the failure of an invasion force of 40,000 to take the city. Massive siege towers were necessary to take the walls. The first was mounted on six ships, but these capsized in a storm before they could be used. A larger, land-based tower was defeated when the defenders flooded the land in front of the walls so that the rolling tower could not move. The next year, a relief force arrived and the siege was abandoned. Much of the iron and bronze was reforged from the various weapons left behind, and the abandoned second siege tower was used for scaffolding.")

                           * People - The people of Elysia are fond of music, dance and all manner of stimulating pastimes. They enhance their features with makeup and dress in flamboyant apparel including velvet blouses and trousers, capes of silken brocade, soft slippers and so forth. The women hide their faces behind decorative fans to give the impression that they are shy and demure. This is hardly the case. The men are even less subtle and are widely regarded as lechers and philanderers in other lands. The Elysians consider romance to be a wonderful game to be played constantly.
                           * Beliefs - The people believe that the world is filled with mysteries and that these mysteries are ultimately unsolvable. The point of life is not to pursue the answers but to marvel at the mysteries themselves. In these beliefs, there is no right or wrong, only perspective and sublty.
                           * Law - The unusual way they see right and wrong, leads to a fairly arbitrary justice system. Small crimes are basically ignored, so petty theft especially pickpocketing is rampant. Major crimes, on the other hand, are dealt with quickly and severely. Trials are held in public with justice determined by popular vote by those attending. Punishment is arbitrarily and creatively disposed by the Mayor of each city.
                           * The Night of Fools - Once each year, the infamous festival known as the night of fools takes place. During this night almost no crimes are prosecuted. People dress in ludicrous costumes and take to the streets in an evening of revelry, debauchery, and mayhem. On the following day, order is restored.
                           * Beggars - Begging is considered an honest, if unenviable, profession in Elysia. Though many are frauds and thieves, the Elysians are fond of their beggars and expect others to be equally open-minded. It is traditional to scatter coppers when beggars appear or suffer public scorn and ridicule.
                           * Bath - Public and private bath houses (with or without masseuse) are a popular pasttime and meeting place similar to a tavern elsewhere complete with snacks and drinks."

                           * Geography - The Order covers a large mountainous pennisula, separated from Elysia, and the Imperium by the Pyrenees mountains.
                           * Daily Life - The influence of the religion is evident everywhere. Individualism has been throughly suppressed. All citizen dress alike, speak in tired cliches, and effect identical mannerisms.
                           * Laws - Laws of the Order are extremely strict and narrowly interpreted. Those who commit even the slightest transgression are dragged to the Halls of Penance. At the discretion of the Inquisitors, non-believers may be forcibly converted or may simply 'disapper'.
                           * Visitors - Travellers from other lands are rare and stand out like beacons. They are generally treated as inferiors and are only tolerated if their presense is of some advantage to the state.
                           * Alms - A person's spiritual enlightenment is measured by the Theocrats in a spiritual value called Alms. Alms are awarded for specific contributions to the church including tithes, military service, good deeds, church titles, pilgrimages, etc. Each rank provides specific perks within society but is also intened to be a direct measure of the quality of the person's afterlife.
                           * Clash of Champions - The Imperium has tried to invade the Order twice to no avail. The geography and religious zealots of the Order have proven too difficult to overcome. Since the last battle, the Order and Elysia (backed by the Imperium) have waged a propaganda war culminating in the annual event known as the Clash of Champions. Each year both nations scout for worthy (and expendible) warriors to represent their interests in a duel atop the main gates of the Order capital. The winner receives great rewards from their sponsor. Though not technically, a duel to the death, it is expected that the loser will be thrown or forced  off the gates to fall 20 feet below to the roar of the crowds. It is considered a particular coup to cause a vanquished foe to fall amongst his or her own supporters. Since the Order and Elysia could scarsely be more different in their outlooks on life, the winners consider their victory to be a referendum on the virtues of their philosophies. The Order takes the competition very seriously and, of course, gambling and drinking are not allowed within the city walls. Elyisians consider the Clash to be one of the social events of the season. Though they must travel through the mountain pass and they are not permitted entrance to the city, they still come in large numbers with their wagons, children, merchants, wenches, gamblers, acrobats, and performers. For the Elysians, the party is equally large whether they win or not."

Its reputation is somewhat exaggerated. The Imperial Legionnaires are the most devastating standing army on the planet, but the Imperium has had its share of defeats and finds it hard to hold territory that it 'conquers'. Fortunately, the Imperium is mostly concerned with trade and is very willing to negotiate with its neighbors and allow autonomy in its territories in order to concentrate on its borders to the east where it faces constant incursions from the Shattered Lands and from the Dragon's Eye.
                       * Currency - Imperial Sovereigns (Imperials or Crowns) are made from gold, have eight sides, and have the image of the current emperor on the front and the imperial seal on the back. They are made of solid gold and are accepted almost everywhere.
                       * Architecture - Imperia has a love of monolithic buildings with towering columns that reflect the Imperial ego.
                       * Roads - The Imperium maintains excellent cobblestone roads throughout its own and its allies territories. All roads lead to Imperia and have armed forts at regular intervals with Centurions, an inn, and a trading post. The forts charge a toll to pass, prices at these forts are high, and any trade done is taxed, but forts are always professionally defended and are generally worth the price.  The roads benefit trade, but are also a reminder of the influence of the Imperium."

           "* If there is a worse place, no one has yet found it. At a glance it appear as a desert world, but it is infinitely worse. The winds have sculpted the rocks and mesas into horrifying shapes. Those who can see through the sandstorms can see demonic forms torturing souls, but their screams are covered by the winds.
            * The howling winds that forever whip across the red sands are enough to strip flesh from bone. Shards of glass and metal blown on these sonic-velocity winds can penetrate tank armor.
            * The winds frequently become funnel clouds sucking sand and souls miles up before letting them plummet onto the jagged rocks below.
            * The constant motion of wind and sand builds up electric charge, and victims are regularly subjected to bolts of lightning.
            * At first, the winds only flay only the body, but the worst is yet to come. Once flesh and muscle fall from the bones, the very essence of his being begins peeling off, layer by layer to be carried off in the winds. The only peace is when the winds subside, and the flayed bodies regenerate in these precious seconds. But once the pain begins to subside, the winds start howling again...
            * Souls trapped here are often those who hoarded and abused power. Such individuals are tormented after death by having everything ripped from them.
            * Tou Mu - The Yama King, Tou Mu, watches from her enormous upside-down palace high in orbit. Those that the Iron Empress takes note of are drawn up by the winds to the cold silent vacuum above. There she expresses her dissatisfaction personally.
            * Silent Stronghold - Her orbiting palace is where her allies stay, but as Tou Mu is paranoid, the crystal of this place renders unguarded thought into sound which echoes throughout the palace.
            * Sinister Fortress - One of the few structures on the surface of this hell, this iron fortress courses with the lightning that constantly strikes it. On the outer walls are lashed the bodies of those that Tou Mu has taken a special interst. Here they are constantly torn by winds and struck by lightning. The Iron Empress has never removed a victim from the wall since the first traitor was lashed there.")

            * This hell is the place of torment for the gluttonous. Corpulent executives and rotund bureaucrats are haunted by the excesses of their lives.
            * Ruler - This realm is ruled by Hluh, an island-sized, gelatinous, bright red jellyfish with sharp-toothed sucker mouths on each tentacle.
            * Devils - The devils of this have no names, no faces, and no sense of self. They realm resemble chitinous tapeworms or gigantic water striders that skim acoss the surface of the boiling sea.")

            * Souls - This is a place of torment for sinners who have met their end by disease including radiation poisoning, cancer, and biological warfare. Boils and tumors grow enormous here and hang from the body and attract the maggots. Within days a soul can feel her skin crawl. Everywhere the worm-ridden souls cry out, tearing at their skin, and vainly trying to escape the worms that are eating them alive.
            * Ruler - Rangda, the Mistress of Pestilence rules here.
            * Demons - Maggots grow larger as they age. The largest of them are the size of a whale.
            * The Great Beast - What appears to be a large white mountain is actually an enormous carcass of an unknown beast. The maggots have been devouring it since the hell was created, and it appears it will take an eternity to complete the job. What the beast is is unknown. Some believe it is tied to creation and the the universe will cease when it is comsumed. A foolish mage once studied it from a distance, but days later he returned screaming gibberish and only said two coherent words before he took his own life: 'It moved.'")

That which is dull cuts while sharp objects bring comfort.

Souls begin to hate those who helped them and love those who have done them wrong. They fear the helpless and refuse to flee certain destruction. Skills and powers do not work correctly here. The stronger the ability the more ineffectual it is.

Fires flicker and die in the winds, but any light attracts the tormented and Shikome alike. The terrain is rocky and frozen black crystal that leech the energy of those who rest on them. Meadows and tree exist, but they are covered with dark crytal blades that tear at passersby.
            * Kakuri is the hell of those who have lost their honor. The land is therefore the anti-thesis of honor. There are no great battles, no great challenges, no bragging enemies. There is no duty, no honor, and no way to escape. There are no flesh eating devils, no pits of burning oil, no grand ministries of torment. In a land without hope, there don't need to be.
            * Ruler: Emma-o, perhaps the greatest of the Yama-kings.
            * Shikome: Beautiful, cold, female devils that delight in speeding their victims to despair. They are subtle and can appear as tormented souls or as friends or lovers. Whatever their form, they will drain the [Spirit] from their victims leaving them to wander in hopelessness and despair.
            * Kyuden No Kakuri - The Castle of Kakuri is the stronghold of Emma-o.  It is situated at the top of an unassailable peak. The castle has elaborate obsidian walls and are a testament to his vanity and conceit.
            * Cave of Maidens - One of Emma-o's favored traps, the caves appear an oasis from the icy torment and occasionally a way out of Yomi. Edible fungi, shelter, and pretty prisoners can be found in the caves. The prisoners will dote on the visitors, but they will suddenly accuse them of theft, rape, murder, or worse. The visitors are beaten and driven from the caves. The power of the Shikome lets them trick their victims again and again with the lure of false hope. Amazingly, there is actually a chance that a cave is actually an exit from the Hell, the ultimate lure for lost souls.")

            * Ruler - Yama-king Wu Hua lives at the the bottom of the pit in a great iron city surrounded by six enormous barbed spires on which hundreds of bodies are impaled. Sputtering greenish fires can be seen from a distance that hint at grotesque rituals and obscene torments, but what exactly goes on inside is unknown.
            * Iron Citadels - The citadels are places of decadence and depravity. The souls are intermittently rotated from the mines to the citadel to act as slaves. Most mine workers view the change as desirable, but every soul chosen learns that this is not the case. In reality, the souls are treated worse here than anywhere else in the domain. Their suffering is more valuable to Wu Hua because it is so much more 'personal'.")

The stench of urine, vomit, blood, and excrement blows out of every alley. The streets and buildings are packed with the souls who mindlessly slave away in inescapable agonies and the power-mad demons who torment them.
            * Souls - This hell is the destination of those who have fallen into the corruption, isolation, and anoymity of urban life. Politicians, artists, criminals, wage slaves, executive, and police are pulled into the sweat shops and dark streets of this doomed megalopolis. The souls are worked beyond their limits, and when they falter or fail the foremen arrive instantly to punish them for their incompetence. Their routine jobs continue day after day with no hope of improving their lot, and their pitiful wages allow them to almost support themselves. Those that fail to keep up are laughed out of their offices and become the homeless of Wicked City, available for demons and embittered salary drones to beat, torture, or set ablaze. There are no safe places in Wicked City. Every coworker could be a demon. Even the doomed may betray each other for advancement. It is a place where the worst elements of greed and capitalism meet.
            * Ruler - The Yama-king Mikaboshi rules this realm from the Mikaboshi Tower. The tower is a hideous tower of blackened steel and glass whose peak disappears into the clouds. Mikaboshi's executives administer Wicked City from this lofty tower, and Mikaboshi himself is often linked directly into the tower's strange devices allowing him to see, hear, and feel any part of Wicked City.
            * Undercity - The twisted spires are built atop the crumbling temples and castles of eras past. The cities are built upon cities upon cities, and the farther down one goes, the more monstrous the demonic inhabitants. Some creatures have not seen the sky in centuries. What these monsters have become is unknown, but no one who has entered the abandoned tunnels and subways has returned sane (if they return at all).
            * Feng Shui - The Yama-king Mikaboshi wants all those who see his city to understand his grand vision of a hellish metropolis. He undermines the known and comfortable trapping of the daily world to increase his subjects' feelings of dread and suffering, and his power over them. The feng shui of the Wicked city is beyond negative, bordering on the impossible. The entire landscape assaults the Chi of the city's victims. 'Poison Arrows' point everywhere, spiraling in directions that cause veritgo from the merest glance. Disharmony saps the will and impedes rational thought.
            * Gates - It is possible to travel to Wicked City from many of the worst urban hellholes in the mortal world. In these places of corruption and anguish, the [Veil] is weak. The door also swings both ways and denizens of this hell sometimes travel to the mortal realm in search of new souls."))
