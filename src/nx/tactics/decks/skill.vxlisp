    "* [Target]: Close combat may only be used to attack the space directly ahead or the space you are on.
     * Fighting very close to the opponent. This includes most martial arts, brawling, and knife fighting.
     * If you don't have a weapon, use the [Bare Handed] item."
   :reference
    "* The usefulness of kicks in self-defense and actual combat has been debated. Kicks are powerful but risk balance, expose the groin, and risk take downs.
     * Joker, there is nothing wrong with you that I can't fix. With my hands. - Batman, The Dark Knight Returns
     * There are seven working defenses from this position. Three of them disarm with minimal contact, three of them kill. The other....hurts. - Batman, The Dark Knight Returns
     * Beat losers, get paid. - Sett, Runeterra
     * The baseline for kicking abilities is that they are -1 Speed and +1 Damage with a minor special ability.

If he fails his roll, then he's still being tailed, if he succeeds, then the tailing pilot gets to attempt the same maneuver (as a 'free' action at full dice pool) - if the 'tail' matches or exceeds the successes rolled by the target plane's pilot, then the tail is maintained for another turn.
     * When a dogged plane attempts a 'reversal' maneuver the effects are the same, except that if the tailing plane scores less successes than the target plane, the roles are reversed."
