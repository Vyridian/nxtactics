     * Benefits: Alchemical substances may be prepared ahead of time, used by others, and sold for profit. Their signature talent is the creation of the Philosopher's Stone that transmutes lead into gold. Because their talents benefit others, Alchemists are in high demand.
     * Penalties: Alchemical substances MUST be prepared ahead of time and require exotic ingredients. Their preparation normally requires the use of a laboratory and special equipment (See Equipment / Alchemical Devices)."

       :summary
        "* The process of working with the prima materia to create the philosopher's stone. It has been used to describe personal and spiritual transmutation.
         * Prima Materia - The ubiquitous starting material required for the magnum opus. It is the primitive formless base of all matter similar to chaos, the quintessence or aether.
         * Process philosophy - An approach to philosophy that identifies processes, changes, or shifting relationships as the only true elements of the ordinary, everyday real world. It treats other real elements (examples: enduring physical objects, thoughts) as abstractions from, or dependents on, processes.
         * Stages of the Magnum Opus
         ** Nigredo - The blackening or melanosis means putrefaction or decomposition. After gathering the Prima Materia, the material and the Alchemist must undergo putrefactio. The material is processed until it turns completely black. This is by far the longest and most difficult stage. It is often known as the 'dark night of the soul.' We are being asked to let go of all within us and outside of us that is not in full alignment with the truth of who we are. This is a truth as it exists on a soul level, far beyond the ego and its limited ideas or illusions about who we 'should' be. It is made far more difficult by the resistance and defenses we put up against it. Many of us will resist for years, remaining unwilling to accept that our lives, as we know them, are over. Few of us are quick to grasp the fact that there is new life waiting for us if we would only let go of the limited vision of existence we usually try so desperately to cling to. It is only when we become willing to surrender that the alchemical process truly begins. Only when we are willing to die do we have the chance to one day be reborn.
         ** Albedo - The whitening or leucosis is the perfect purification. The material is further processed removing all blackness until only pure white remains. Then it is said that life has conquered death, that the king has been revived. When one has purified his awareness of Self, during meditation, by eliminating thoughts, or otherwise, then at a certain point, light appears. The light that appears is also metaphoric for an absolute clear, pure awareness of Self. In that state one is in a very fixed position, that is, very stable, very much in the here and now, in total clarity of Self. In Whiteness, the material has attained a degree of Fixedness that fire cannot destroy.
         ** Rubedo - The reddening, purpling, or iosis. When the White stone or the White Elixir has been made, it needs to purified further, sublimated, until the material becomes totally Fixed and is completely stable. Then we have the Red Sulfur, the red stone, the Red Elixir, the Stone of the Wise. When the divine light has emerged during meditation, one needs to make it last. this demands a continued effort of holding one's attention to this pure awareness, not only for the length of the meditation session, but also during every day life. At a certain point the pure awareness of one's divine self will be permanent."

     * Action: Check Skill vs. the Value of the item to create. If successful, the item can be used a number of times equal to the result before disintegrating. If the user has a specialty with an item, that specialty may be applied to the check.
     * Benefits - Conjuration is the natural ability of the Astral Realm and Dream Realm. All abilities are +1 in these Realms.
     * Limitations - Creation magic is exceedingly difficult with only relatively minor creations possible. The process of Conjuration is different from natural things, so all Conjured things have some imperfection or mark that distinquishes itself from a natural thing.

    "* Fetishism is using a symbol to represent the thing you want to affect with your magic. Whatever you do to the symbol, you do to the target. The object and the thing it represents are 'in sympathy'; they are aligned. Sympathetic magic is a useful idea because often, your target is something non-physical, or something you can’t otherwise interact with directly. You could banish negative thoughts directly, but it’s easier to tie them to something physical by writing them down and then burning the paper. As the paper burns, so does the negativity. Correspondences are related to this. For example, different-colored candles represent different desires (like green for money, red for love, black for banishment, etc.) and as the candle burns down, your spell is cast. Wearing different stones or crystals can attract luck or success to you.   
     * Cursed Energy - Cursed energy is born from negative emotions such as grief and anger. These negative feelings are common in human society so almost everyone possesses cursed energy. Cursed Energy can be controlled and focused to perform various magical feats.
     * Cursed Spirit - Cursed Spirits are apparitions manifested entirely from cursed energy. Even their bodies are composed of cursed energy, making cursed spirits invisible to non-sorcerers. The emission of cursed energy from humans collects like sediment until a cursed spirit is born from the collective negative energy. Cursed Spirits born with strong feelings directed toward a certain aspect are especially strong. The stronger humanity's fear and anger is directed at cursing a certain aspect of the world, like natural disasters, the more powerful Curse Spirits spawned from those negative sentiments will be.
     * Law of Similarity - Like produces like. An effect resembles its cause.

     * The word 'right' derives from the Hebrew term 'yamin' from the Old Testament, meaning 'stronger'. In Hebrew, the term for 'left' is 'smowl', meaning 'dark'.
     * It is possible that this division also derives from the practice of using the left hand for purposes of personal hygiene after defecation in some cultures, rendering the left hand 'unclean'."
   :summary
    "* Calling or summoning a spirit, demon, god or other supernatural agent for assistance.
     * Right Hand Path - Elevates spirituality, the strict observance of moral codes, and the worship of deities. The goal is to attain proximity to divinity, or integration with divinity.
     * Left Hand Path - Conversely, Left Hand Path values the advancement and preservation of the self, glorification of more temporal and terrestrial goals, and personal power rather than ephemeral spiritual attainments. Rather than valuing proximity to the divine, followers of Left-Hand Path belief systems seek to become divinities in their own right."

       :summary
        "* Faster than light travel can be accomplished by warping space into a Wormhole/Black hole, dropping out of normal space and travelling through the parallel universe called Hyperspace/Tachyon Space where physical laws are not bound by the relationship between mass and the speed of light, and finally returning to normal space by creating another space warp.
         * Hyperspace/Tachyon Space - Tachyon Space, like other dimensions is at right angles to our existing 3 dimension. In Hyperspace, time and distance have different meanings, all particles are tachyons, and the speed of light is an absolute minimum speed instead of a maximum. Travelling through Hyperspace is exceptionally hazardous. In fact, any deviation from the calculated route cause the corridor to collapse leaving one stranded in Hyperpace forever with no way to calculate a return.
         * Calculating a Route - Once a destination is chosen, complex calculations must be performed to calculate a direct route from the current location to the destination through the shifting reality of Hyperspace. A successful route will be a 'straight' line through Hyperspace. Proximity to a gravity well makes these calculations next to impossible. Typically, all ship computer resources are required for this calculation and the larger the ship fewer the available routes and therefore the greater the complexity. Ships may only enter and exit hyperspace at the edge of a solar system and must use conventional sub light drives within the system. A day or more at sub-light speed is therefore required to reach or leave a planet in an inner solar system. Route calculation time is roughly light years x tons / 10secs e.g. 4 light years x 100 tons / 10 = 40sec.
         * Hyperspace Corridor - Once calculated, the ship must meet the speed defined by the calculation while modulating the Hyperdrive energy signature to match the bridge to Hyperspace. If all goes well, the vast energies in Tachyon Space will form a corridor directly to the destination. Errors in any of the steps usually involve intense gravitional shearing forces that will at best cause damage to the Hyperdrive and leave the traveller stranded in deep space, or worse, Hyperspace.
         * Travel in Hyperspace - Hyperspace travel is typically a boring affair. The Hyperspace corridor carries the ship to its destination, so no manuevering is needed. The time spent in Hyperspace varies, but is usually proportional to the distance. Transit time is roughly 2 hours per light year travelled (e.g. 4 light years x 2 = 8hours)
         * Tachyon Doppler Effect - When the Hyperspace Corridor is created, both ends of the corridor will start leaking Tachyons which can be detected by sensitive instruments. The amount of Tachyons increases with the size of the ship, the distance travelled and the closer the time of arrival.
         * Tachyon Relay Network - Satellites at the edge of stellar systems use Hyperspace Corridors to beam tranmissions through Hyperspace to their opposites in other systesm. Since these communications have negligible mass, the calculations are nearly instantaneous though the same transit times apply.
         * History - Imaginary Space, I-Space - While studying fusion plant efficiency using various algorithms, a surprising discovery was made: very rarely and seemingly at random, the plant would produce a tiny tachyon burst. After decades of study, a pattern began to emerge along with a shocking discovery: only algorithms using imaginary numbers could trigger a burst and a small amount of particles were actually disappearing during the event. Where the particles were going became the primary focus of astrophysics from then on. Eventually a hypothesis gathered momentum. The particles were leaving real space and traveling along trajectories plotted through so called imaginary space. This implied that the destination of the particles could be predicted. After much trial and error another breakthrough: a second tachyon burst moments after the first and many kilometers away. The particles had returned. Faster than light travel was possible. The implications for communications were immediately obvious, but could something larger make the trip? Research was slow because increased mass meant increased complexity. The power and computational needs were high but not unachievable. Only a decade later the first successful test craft made the trip. A decade later commercial hyperdrives became available. A decade later they were affordable on even modest starships."
