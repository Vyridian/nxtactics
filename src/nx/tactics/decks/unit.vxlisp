Not the spitting image of a fertility goddess but this is as close as the mythos gets. Shub-Niggurath may well be the most widely revered amoung the other gods, infuence reaching not only to the Greeks, Cretans, Egyptions, and some druids, but to races so far-flung across the cosmos as the Mi-go of Yuggoth, and the Dhole and Nug-Soth of Yaddith. ... Usually the creation of new life, especially intelligent life, is held as a sacred act. Many humans derive joy and self-import from the notion that their kind was toild over by some kind of divine intelligence. Shub-Niggurath with her blind, indifferent, prolific procreation, undermines this idea. ... Shub-Niggurath was Lovecraft's affirmation that life itself is nothing extrodinary. - Tale Foundry"

    "* Movement - They can swim and climb trees.
     * Venomous Bite - Vipers carry a limited amount of venom. They can control the amount that injected including none at all.
     * Venom - Viperid venoms typically contain an abundance of protein-degrading enzymes, called proteases, that produce symptoms such as pain, strong local swelling and necrosis, blood loss from cardiovascular damage complicated disruption of the blood-clotting system. Death is usually caused by collapse in blood pressure. Due to the nature of proteolytic venom, a viperid bite is often a very painful experience and should always be taken seriously, though it may not necessarily prove fatal. Even with prompt and proper treatment, a bite can still result in a permanent scar, and in the worst cases, the affected limb may even have to be amputated.
      * Vision - They do not have heat vision unlike Pit Vipers"
