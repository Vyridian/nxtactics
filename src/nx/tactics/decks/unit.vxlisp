    "* Movement - They can swim and climb trees.
     * Venomous Bite - Vipers carry a limited amount of venom. They can control the amount that injected including none at all.
     * Venom - Viperid venoms typically contain an abundance of protein-degrading enzymes, called proteases, that produce symptoms such as pain, strong local swelling and necrosis, blood loss from cardiovascular damage complicated disruption of the blood-clotting system. Death is usually caused by collapse in blood pressure. Due to the nature of proteolytic venom, a viperid bite is often a very painful experience and should always be taken seriously, though it may not necessarily prove fatal. Even with prompt and proper treatment, a bite can still result in a permanent scar, and in the worst cases, the affected limb may even have to be amputated.
      * Vision - They do not have heat vision unlike Pit Vipers"
