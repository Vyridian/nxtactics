When they attempted to colonize the oceans, the polyps were driven back by the Elder Things. Thereafter, they restricted their habitats to the surface world.
    * Their senses did not include sight, but what senses they had could penetrate all material obstructions. They were only partially matter, but still solid enough to affect and be stopped by normal materials; this additionally gave them resistance, if not outright invulnerability, to normal means of damage, though they could be destroyed by certain forms of electrical energy. Their minds were so strange that the Great Race of Yith could not perform psychic transfers with them.
    * They are able to levitate and fly despite lacking any visible means of doing so, and leave telltale massive footprints when on the ground. Their amorphous bodies can turn invisible at will, though this ability appears somewhat negated by whistling noises associated with them in general. In battle, their ability to control and direct powerful winds is put to use as a weapon.
    * When the Great Race of Yith came to Earth, they warred with the polyps and soon drove them underground with their advanced technology. The Great Race then sealed the entryways to the polyps' subterranean abode with trapdoors, which afterwards were diligently guarded. The polyps' cities were left abandoned, perhaps as a reminder of the horrors that dwelt below.
    * Eventually, the polyps rose up and almost exterminated the Great Race, afterwards returning to their subterranean haunts. Having no conception of light, the polyps seem content to remain there, annihilating the few intruders that chance upon them. The entrances to their dwellings are mostly deep within ancient ruins where there are great wells sealed over with stone.")

     * Personality - Galamir is a brilliant Wizard and strategist, but he is impatient with others and has no respect for politics or idle chit-chat.
     * History - Galamir was born to Chantry trainers, and as a child he was allowed special access to the arcane academy. As a teen, he became obsessed with magic and its effect on the world. His brilliance and magical aptitude were soon recognized and he was accepted into the academy. For the next 25 years he completed his full wizardry and elemental training and received top honors. He was a logical 	candidate to become a trainer himself, but he was bored of the cloistered life, so he began visiting other Chantries across the world. Along the way he encountered a naive, young half-elf rogue named Phirax living on a simple farm. Galamir recruited Phirax to join him to perform the more dangerous and mundane tasks while Galamir provided the leadership and strategy. Later, he recruited the Warrior Stam and the Cleric Sarak into their party to rounded out their abilities."

The Mi-Go have a sort of convoluted ellipsoid where its head should be, covered with a multitude of very short antennae.
    * They have a colony on Pluto (i.e. Yuggoth) and have mining colonies in high mountains looking for rare minerals.
    * The Mi-go are not wholly native to our phyical universe. Thus, they cannot eat food from Earth, and photographs of them are blurry and indistinct. They can also fly unassisted through interstellar space at fantastic speeds. They dissolve shortly after death.
    * They are unaccustomed to light which confuses them.
    * They seem to be highly focused on their scientific pursuits and are most often encountered in search of obscure minerals in remote places. Trespassers are usually eliminated, though they have been known to have human agents work on their behalf.
    * Mi-go have access to a number of advanced weapons. The mist projector releases a cloud of frigid gas. They have an organic 'armor' that humans can use, but it is extremely sticky and will damage the user each time it is removed. The armor will also weaken each day unless immersed in the proper nutrient bath.
    * The Mi-Go are advanced in the sphere of surgery. With surgical alterations the Mi-Go are able to speak human languages, though their voice is buzzy and irritating. They can also surgically move the brain of other species into metal cylinders for transportation to other worlds through space.
    * Essentially a space fungus, the crablike form we're accustom to is actually a pressure suit that allows them to walk around, speak and fly in Earth's atmosphere. They grow their 'bodies' likes coral and can form appendages to anything they require - wings, arms, shells. Each of these shells is alive and using grafting, they can switch out limbs as needed. The discarded limbs are kept alive like potted plants until they are needed again.
    * They are alien extremophiles, perfectly suited for deep space travel. They don't require air to breathe, are capable of periods of hibernation lasting hundreds of thousands of years, feed off minerals and cosmic radiation, using something like photosynthesis to make food.
    * They procreate by budding, a form of cloning, to make copies of the older, mature individuals and use spores to create their workforce - bred to labor and die in the mines. They can bore deep into the mantel of worlds, and as they don't require air to breath and can survive incredible heat, cold and pressure, they can just keep going deeper while most species would die in moments.
    * They communicate and see via radiation, the flowerlike sensory organ we view as their head, emits and receives radioactive wavelengths, allowing them to see through walls and for miles clearly as they have no eyes to focus. They can see the background radiation of the universe and use it to travel with precision between stars. This also means they can see the elemental make up of asteroids and planets just by looking at them."

The subject wakes abruptly usually accompanied by gasping, moaning, or screaming.  It is often impossible to fully awaken the person, and after the episode the subject normally settles back to sleep without waking.
     * Night terrors are distinct from nightmares in several key ways. First, the subject is not fully awake when roused, and even when efforts are made to awaken the sleeper, he/she may continue to experience the night terror for ten to twenty minutes. Unlike nightmares, which occur during REM sleep, night terrors occur during slow-wave sleep, the deepest levels of non-REM sleep. Even if awakened, the subject often cannot remember the episode except for a sense of panic, while nightmares usually can be easily recalled. The subject often has no recollection of the incident.
     * Unlike nightmares, which are frequently dreams of a frightening nature, night terrors are not dreams. Usually there is no situation or event (scary or otherwise) that is dreamt, but rather the emotion of fear itself is felt. The lack of a dream itself leaves those awakened from a night terror in a state of disorientation much more severe than that caused by a normal nightmare. This can include a short period of amnesia during which the subjects may be unable to recall their names, locations, ages, or any other identifying features of themselves.

     * Night Terrors, being exclusively female, can only reproduce by mating with a male member of another species. The hag often slays her mate. The child born looks like a normal member of her species with black or blue hair and is often given into foster care by the hag disguised as a normal woman.

Though he typically appears as a man, he has innumerable other forms and may be able to appear in any form he wishes. He seens to specifically target and toy with humanity by offering dangerous knowledge and observing the results. This is probably an overly simplistic view of his actions. Like the other Other Gods, he is too grand a figure to care about humanity. More likely, he acts like Yog-Sothoth and simply appears as an avatar and provides Knowledge to those who seek him without regard to what we do with it. In this way, Nyarlathotep is like Prometheus providing fire to humanity. It is possible that Nyarlathotep is constantly offering knowledge, but we are generally unable to recognize it. Perhaps Nyarlathotep is the Muse behind all discoveries.")

He strongly believes he is on the right path in life and has developed very strong emotional confidence which lets him roll with the whatever comes his way. He appreciates plans and planners, but he feels that plans must always be flexible because they rarely predict a situation accurately.
     * Beliefs - Phirax believes that improving the lives of those around him will also improves his own life. He sees this as selfishness through selflessness, therefore it is always in his own interest to help others. He could easily manipulate those around him, but he abhors the idea of exploiting others and is quick to judge abusers of any kind. He follows the lesser god Seker on his mission to destroy undead, specifically those who feed on or otherwise exploit the living (which is pretty much all of them).
     * History - Phirax was born into a large family on a farm bordering the Arden Forest. During the day, he learned diverse combat and survival skills with the Elves of the forest. At night he practiced various social skills at the human tavern. He was planning to set out on his own soon when he encountered a rather awkward and self-important Wizard named Galamir. After he confirmed the Wizard's abilities, he agreed to join him as a pair of traveling adventurers. Soon after, the pair teamed up with a Warrior and a Cleric. With the party complete, they set out for danger and treasure."

Though generally well-intentioned, they are deceitful, devious, and more than a little goofy. Mundaneness disturbs them, and they have a particular fear of Banality.
     * Empathy - Though they seem immature, they are capable of great sadness and empathy, which they try to assuage by telling jokes and playing pranks. Lack of humor mystifies them and usually drives them to 'cheer up' their quarry with more manic pranks. Naturally, Unseelie pranks tend to be sick and twisted. For all their mischief, they have a strong sense of nobility and are loyal to friends and courageous in battle.
     * Deceitful - Truth is boring to Pooka, so they will pepper it with lies to make it more interesting. 	Because of their trickster nature, they are actually unable to tell a completely true statement. Though pookas never tell the entire truth, they also never lie completely which is crass and banal. Partially truths and partial lies are what pookas enjoy.
     * Manipulating - Pooka are masters of manipulation. While their actions appear random and sometimes comical, events seem to play out toward their grand designs.
     * Unpredictable - Pooka are never one thing. They are usually calm and humorous, but they are very capable of being cunning and cruel and can change moods in an instant.
     * Limited Shapechange - A pooka naturally has an animal form but may change to human form when no one is watching. They may stay in either form indefinitely with no effort, but a part of them always hints at their true nature. Sometimes a tail or fur remains. Sometimes hair can appear like long ears. Sometimes they hide a large animal tattoo.
     * Tails - Powerful Pooka have additional tails. The most powerful have nine. They start with 1 tail at level 1 and gain a tail every odd level up to 9 tails at level 17.
     * Illusion - Pooka are practiced illusionists and love using illusions for pranks and generally harmless fun. Consistent with their nature, Pooka illusions always have some truth mixed with lies. Their illusions always have hidden flaws that the Pooka purposely addes for their own entertainment.

Simply killing the body is not enough to end its haunting, as it reappears from another pumpkin on the next moonless night. To finally destroy a scarecrow, every scrap of every body must be burned, as well as any pumpkins or pumpkin vines. The land must then be tilled and planted with a new crop. Only then are the spirits forced to give up their vengeance and give up the mortal coil.

He originally believed that he was a young man who could transform into a robot, but he has since learned that his actual body died long ago and that his personality is just an artificial duplicate. After this discovery, his humanity has gradually diminished over time.
     * Synthetic - Senturion does not need to eat, sleep or breathe. He is composed of molecular machines that twist and wrap in layers of ceramic wire filaments. These multipurpose filaments reconfigure into different forms to heal or create custom weapons. These filaments must always remain connected to the main body or they self-destruct to maintain their secrets. If Senturion loses a limb, the resulting explosion can cause significant damage.
     * Body - He has tremendous strength and endurance and can withstand extreme temperatures, pressures, and the vacuum of space. His body is very flexible, and he can contort himself to escape confinement of fit through small gaps.
     * Mind - His computer brain greatly increases his ability to quickly process information and create complex strategies.
     * Speed - Senturion moves and reacts with lightning speed and precision. He can run at 80mph and can briefly run on walls. His graceful movements belie his great strength and significant weight.
     * Leaping - Senturion can jump 40ft in the air.
     * Eyes - Senturion's eyes can emit tight-beam lasers or a white sheet of explosive energy. He can sense electromagnetic radiation (including infrared and ultraviolet). He also possesses telescopic and microscopic vision.
     * Transformation - As Mech-Man he was able to transform from a human-like form to his mechanical form. He has since lost this ability (and a great deal of his human personality). As Senturion he has refined this power to produce specialized weapons like blades and spikes.
     * Healing - Senturion's android body rapidly repairs itself.
     * Filaments - In close combat, filaments can emerge from its body which can scramble or override electrical devices on contact.
     * History - Senturion was designed as one of a multitude of multi-purpose exploratory probes. Their natural form is a squirming mass of pale filaments. These probes were packed into artificial comets and launched in all directions from their homeworld. To protect their designers, they possess no memory of their origin or ultimate purpose. Many of these probes have landed on all planets in the solar system and millions more are littered across the galaxy. Most were buried underground by their impact and there they lie dormant. The ones on the surface seek a power source to fuel their growth and adaptation to their environment. They absorb light, heat, electricity or other radiation. When fully charged, they quietly begin exploring and analyzing their environment for possible resources and threats. If the planet is lifeless, they will catalog the available resources and begin creating more identical probes. If the planet is inhabited, they will wait and study the local wildlife until they are confident that they can completely mimic a sample of the apex species. Then they will begin to blend into the local society to learn everything they can. When their analysis no longer produces significant results, they begin to create more probes. Though they are unaware of their creator or purpose, they continue to catalog and expand. Eventually, their data network reaches back to their creators who collect this massive treasure trove of data."

     * Black mambas are among the ten most venomous snakes in the world. A single bite may inject enough venom to kill from 20-40 grown men. When cornered, they will readily attack. In fact, many snake experts have cited the black mamba as the world's most aggressive snake, noting tendency to actively attack without provocation. When warding off a threat, the black mamba usually delivers multiple strikes, injecting its potent neuro-and cardiotoxin with each strike, often attacking the body or head, unlike most other snakes.
     * Black mambas tend to live in their lairs for long periods of time, which are often vacated insect mounds or hollow trees. Black mambas are diurnal snakes that hunt prey actively day or night.
     * The black mamba is more than 3 times as venomous as the Cape Cobra, over 5 times as venomous as the King cobra and about 40 times as venomous as the Gaboon viper. Black mamba venom contains powerful, rapid-acting neurotoxins and cardiotoxins. The initial symptom of the bite is local pain in the bite area, although not as severe as snakes with hemotoxins. The victim then experiences a tingling sensation in the extremities, drooping eyelids, tunnel vision, sweating, excessive salivation, and lack of muscle control (specifically the mouth and tongue). If the victim does not receive medical attention, symptoms rapidly progress to nausea, shortness of breath, confusion, and paralysis. Eventually, the victim experiences convulsions, respiratory failure, and coma, and dies due to suffocation resulting from paralysis of the muscles used for breathing.

Due to the nature of proteolytic venom, a viperid bite is often a very painful experience and should always be taken seriously, though it may not necessarily prove fatal. Even with prompt and proper treatment, a bite can still result in a permanent scar, and in the worst cases, the affected limb may even have to be amputated.

    "* The Tremere is the second youngest clan having appeared in the Dark Ages.
     * History - The Tremere began as House Tremere, mages of the Order of Hermes named for their leader and founder, Tremere. At the end of the first millennium, the members of House Tremere realized the Hermetic arts were failing and found its immortality potions no longer working. House Tremere undertook numerous experiments, but it was Goratrix who devised a solution in his investigation of vampires. In 1022, Goratrix invited Tremere and six of the founder's closest advisers to participate in the completed ritual, which promised true immortality. Whether Goratrix knew what would happen is known only by him and, perhaps, Tremere, but at the completion of the ritual the participants fell unconscious and were reborn as vampires, their avatars destroyed and magical abilities lost. The mages had gained their immortality but lost the power they lived for. In time, the Tzimisce made war against House Tremere in retribution for the Fiends that had been made part of Goratrix's experiments. The Order of Hermes also became suspicious of diabolical practices being performed by the increasingly secretive House. In 1037 Tremere gathered the seven newly-made Cainites and forced the blood bond upon them. He then declared to them that House Tremere would be restructured with a new pyramid hierarchy, placing himself at the top as Primus of House and clan Tremere and his seven closest followers forming the Inner Council of Seven directly under him. They would slowly begin Embracing the rest of the House, with each initiate being bound to the Inner Council to ensure their loyalty. In time, all members of House Tremere would die or become vampires. While Tremere and Etrius pursued their own research throughout Europe in converting the hermetic arts into Thaumaturgy, Goratrix once again returned to his laboratories with his apprentices at hand. After years of experimentation on captured Tzimisce, Nosferatu, and Gangrel, he succeeded in creating a Gargoyle in 1121, and by 1125 the hybrids were serving as shock troops against the Fiends. Nevertheless, the Tremere found themselves third-class citizens among the undead. Whatever boldness Tremere had shown in entering the night was ignored by the staunchly traditionalist clans, and they were often forced from cities by princes who did not look kindly on their presumption. As he and Etrius rapidly acquired more vampiric lore they discovered the history of Caine and the Antediluvians, as well as the benefits of diablerie. Seeking to establish themselves as a clan proper, the Tremere sought a clan founder to diablerize and settled on Saulot, the enigmatic founder of the Salubri clan. In 1133, Tremere and the Inner Council discovered Saulot's tomb in the Anatolian desert. Tremere diablerized the Antediluvian and promptly entered torpor, leaving the Inner Council to lead the clan and destroy the remaining Salubri. As with everything else that the Tremere had done to this point, the result was a mixed blessing. The Tremere were entrenched in many Cainite courts, their services as mages making them indispensable to princes across Europe. They were now accepted as one of the Low Clans, albeit considered usurpers, distrusted warlocks, and known diablerists. In the early years of the 21st century, the Intellegence agencies of the United States managed to gain access to SchreckNet and gained firsthand knowledge of the existence of a race of undead bloodsuckers that were spread in all corners of the world. Sharing their knowledge with other intelligence agencies, the united secret services contacted the Vatican, whom they knew to have experience fighting the undead. After years of careful research, the Second Inquisition had targeted Vienna as the 'capital of vampires' and prepared a strike against their headquarters. In 2008, a united USSOCOM and Vatican ESOG force stormed the Vienna Chantry of Clan Tremere and destroyed it, blaming it to an ISIS terror attack to the public. London, Las Vegas, Paris, and Marseilles were largely cleared of vampiric activity, with numerous captured vampires being placed in black sites and experimented upon to discover their weaknesses. The Inner Council of Seven were slain and their Blood Bonds shattered. Since then the once monolithic Tremere structure has completely fallen apart."

     * A Wight is created when an extremely driven, evil person is on the verge of death. Before death, it makes a bargain with a demonic force, and returns to unlife as a Wight.
     * Wights retain most of their abilities while living. Powerful Wights can be as powerful as Liches. In fact, the necromantic study of Wights led to the necromantic rituals responsible for Mummies and Liches.")

    "* Hearing - The upper range of a wolfs' hearing is upwards of 80 kHz. The upper range of humans is only 20 kHz. A wolf can hear up to 6 miles away in forest and 10 miles in open areas, including some high-pitched sounds that a human can't hear. Even when it sleeps, a wolf's ears stand straight up so it can catch sounds. Unlike humans, wolves can easily tell what direction sound is coming from by turning their ears from side to side.
     * Smell - The wolf's sense of smell is about 100 times better than a human's. It can smell prey more than a mile away if the wind is right. It can sense an animal three days after it's gone. Wolves finished a test to locate hidden food in five minutes that domestic dogs took over an hour to finish.
     * Vision - Beyond a short distance their vision must be somewhat blurred. Nevertheless, wolves can see shapes and, especially, movement over long distances, and their peripheral vision is extremely accurate.  They are able to detect even the slightest movements of very small animals, such as a mosquito, at a distance of more than ten feet. There is some controversy as to whether wolves see in color or black and white. Regardless, it is unlikely that they see the various hues of the spectrum as humans see them, because the physical makeup of the eye is different. Nighttime vision for wolves is many times better than human vision in the day or night. Wolves can actually see much better and even much more clearly at night. The eyes of the wolf are like most predators, with a sight-field of nearly 180 degrees and pointed forward.")

For this reason, he is one of the most heavily worshipped entities among the Other Gods. His name is frequently invoked during the rituals and incantations of those seeking hidden knowledge. And often, he answers. Sadly for the ones who call on him, the knowledge he grants almost always leads to madness and self-destruction. Not because Yog-Sothoth is evil or malevolent. He doesn't force anyone to turn the key or step through the gate. ... He is both the danger of knowledge and the inability of man to handle it. His role in the mythos mirrors Lovecraft's own self-taught obsession with the sciences as well as his acedemic failings. - Tale Foundry")
