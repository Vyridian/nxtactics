               "* The Battle of Verdun was a ten month long ordeal between the French and German armies and is considered one of the most brutal events of WWI. Both the French and German armies suffered incredibly with an estimated 540,000 French and 430,000 German casualties and no strategic advantages were gained for either side.
* In the years preceding World War I, Germany became Europe's leading industrial power. France felt increasingly threatened by German industrialization. As a response to the German threat of invasion, France built a continuous line of sunken forts from the Swiss frontier to the French city of Verdun making Verdun a vital strong point.
* The German attack began on February 21, 1916 with an intense artillery bombardment of the forts surrounding Verdun. The French army retreated to predetermined positions while the German army pounded through the French lines.
* Although three French forts near Verdun had capitulated to German forces, Verdun itself remained undefeated.
* By April 1916, the French Air Force had secured the sky over Verdun, which would help the French to successfully defend the area. The British attack and a Russian offensive in the east forced the German army to transfer troops away from Verdun.
* By December 1916, the French had advanced to their February 1916 lines, their original position. No new advantage had been gained for either side.")

Combined with the BEF (British Expeditionary Force) the Germans were eventually halted and the War settled into the familiar defensive series of entrenchment's.
* Ironically, by the end of May, 1918, the Germans had again reached the Marne after the enormous successes of Ludendorff's offensives of that year. The intervening four years had cost hundreds of thousands of lives and the armies were still, literally, exactly where they had started.")

* The first, in 1914 was an attempt by the BEF to halt the rapid advances made by the Germans.
* The second, in 1915, was notable for the first use of poison gas by the Germans.
* However, it is the long-planned offensive of July 31, 1917, that holds the most significance. Here, a combination of over-ambitious aims, appalling weather conditions, and misguided persistence by Haig led to horrific losses. By the time the offensive was called off total casualties for both sides had been approximately 250,000. The horrors of the battle, in which men drowned in liquid mud has become synonymous with the images of the War.")

* The mistrust that High Command had of the so-called 'New Armies' manifested itself in the orders to the troops to keep uniformed lines and to march towards the enemy across no-man's land. This, coupled with the failure of the artillery bombardment to dislodge much of the German wire, or to destroy their machine-gun posts, led to one of the biggest slaughters in military history.
* After the first day, with a gain of only 1.5km, the British had suffered 57,470 casualties. Despite this, Haig pressed on with the attack until November 19th of the same year. For the meager achievements, total losses on the British and Imperial side numbered 419,654 with German casualties between 450,000 and 680,000. When the offensive was eventually called off the British were still 3 miles short of Bapaume and Serre, part of their first-day objectives.")

A surprise artillery barrage started the offensive and 476 tanks, packed tightly for a mass attack moved against the German lines. Supported by infantry the gains were dramatic, breaching the almost impregnable Hindenberg line to depths of 4-5 miles in some places. However, these gains seemed to surprise British High Command equally as much as the Germans, and the following cavalry failed to take advantage. Nevertheless, Cambrai demonstrated how a well-thought out attack, combining tanks en masse with surprise, could be used to break the trench deadlock.")))))

        "Turning Points of the War"
         (section
          :name "Turning Points of the War"
          :summary
           "* While the unconditional surrender of German armed forces represented a resounding Allied success, in retrospect, it is clear that particular factors and choices strongly affected the pace and course of the campaign.
* D-Day - The Allied deception as to where the D-Day landings would take place was very successful, with the majority of the German command convinced the landings would take place at Calais. The Germans underestimated Allied willingness to risk an amphibious assault over a route longer than the shortest path across the English Channel.
* Hedgerows - While the Allies meticulously planned the D-Day landings, they failed to assess the countryside immediately beyond the beaches, which resulted in the Germans very successfully using the hedgerow country as a system of natural defensive works that took the Allies two months to clear at a staggering cost in infantry casualties. Historians have also asserted the U.S. Army should have landed on the eastern end of the Normandy beaches and formed the northern wing of Allied forces in Northwest Europe because the mobility of American forces could have been better used in the more open terrain and most direct route to Berlin that the northern approach offered. As it was, the pre-invasion basing of troops in England determined the arrangement of the landing forces.
* Underestimation - While the Germans had reason to occasionally doubt Allied military proficiency, it is clear the Germans too often underestimated Allied competency. This habit of underestimation led to the rejection of any notion that the Allies might have broken German military ciphers, most famously the Enigma code. The ability to monitor German military communications was an Allied strategic asset of the highest order. Less dramatically, the Germans often underestimated Allied troop proficiency, a habit that resulted in occasional sharp defeats for overconfident German units.
* Manpower - The German ability to form a cohesive defensive line after the disaster their forces endured in Normandy was due almost entirely to the ability of the German Ersatzheer (Replacement Army) to quickly deploy large numbers of new troops. These inexperienced troops were paired with seasoned cadres who swiftly transformed the replacements into combat units. Thus, while the Allies took large numbers of German prisoners during their advance from Normandy to the German border, they  underestimated the ability of the Germans to reconstitute their forces under very disadvantageous circumstances. The Allies also seriously underestimated the infantry casualties their forces would suffer in Northwestern Europe. Shortages of American manpower were strongly aggravated by a tendency to attack head-on regardless of circumstances, a habit that was particularly in evidence during the months of fighting in the Huertgen Forest. The Allied logistical crisis that dominated their operations from September through December had the further pernicious effect of limiting the number of divisions in England that could be moved onto the continent to reinforce the front, since the Allies were only able to supply a limited number of divisions east of the Seine River. After the Allies mastered the logistical crisis, the Americans diverted divisions bound for the Pacific Theater to Europe in a belated realization that more divisions were needed for operations in Europe.
* German Strategic Errors - While the Germans achieved strategic surprise with their offensive in the Ardennes, the Panzer divisions that had been so painstakingly rebuilt could have been more profitably used to defend the Siegfried Line and the Rhineland, or perhaps, in the defense of Berlin against the Red Army. The German thrust failed to shatter their enemies' alliance and cost Germany high casualties and equipment losses it could ill-afford. This folly was repeated in Alsace in January, but with the added disadvantage this time that the Allies were expecting the attack.
* American Strategic Errors - Upon breaking out of Normandy in August, the Americans committed two armored divisions to operations in Brittany when armored units were direly needed for the pursuit of the German army across France. While the port of Brest, France was ultimately captured by the Americans, it consumed operations for an entire month and ultimately did little for the Allied effort because the Germans so thoroughly destroyed the port before it was captured. Out of fear that two wings of their forces might collide, the Allies failed to definitively close the Falaise Gap in August, allowing trapped German forces an escape route to the east. Experienced German leadership cadres evaded Allied forces and were available to reconstitute a cohesive front line along the Siegfried Line.
* Antwerp - Although British forces conducted a brilliant pursuit across northern France that resulted in the liberation of the critically important port of Antwerp in early September, they failed to promptly clear the Scheldt Estuary of Germans. The Germans immediately grasped the significance of the Scheldt Estuary and moved in troops to conduct a lengthy defense. The port of Antwerp could not be used until November 28, and strongly contributed to the lengthy logistical crisis that hamstrung Allied operations for four months.
* Operation Market-Garden was a double failure in the sense that the resources used for it would have been more profitably committed to clearing the Scheldt Estuary instead of carving out an extended salient that did nothing but extend an already over-extended Allied front line.
* Siegfreid Line - Despite grave shortages of riflemen, American operations in front of the Siegfried Line, particularly in U.S. First Army's area, were characterized by bloody frontal assaults. Stubbornness and misplaced notions that the U.S. Army could not allow itself to abandon unprofitable operations saw five infantry divisions shredded in the Huertgen Forest fighting, with the attack being abandoned only in December after the Germans attacked into the Ardennes. The concentration of divisions in the Huertgen Forest also forced a corresponding lack of concentration along the Ardennes front, with the result that only four U.S. divisions were initially available to parry a 26 division German offensive.
* Eisenhower - When, in November, the Allies enjoyed significant success in 6th Army Group's area, General Eisenhower refused to reinforce the success and even forbade his commanders in the south to attempt to assault across the Rhine in the area of Strasbourg while the German defenses were in shambles. This lack of bold enterprise was a by-product of General Eisenhower's decision to conduct limited-objective attacks on a broad front even though the Allies lacked a sufficient number of divisions to both man a broad front and concentrate enough combat power in chosen areas to achieve breakthroughs. When American troops reached the Elbe River in mid-April, General Eisenhower unilaterally decided that Berlin was no longer a significant military objective. He knew that Berlin would be deep within the Soviet zone of post-war Germany and saw no reason to fight for land that would have to be given to the Soviets after the war. Eisenhower pointed out to Patton that it was of no military strategic value and would take up a lot of resources to occupy and asked Patton 'Who would want it?' Patton replied 'I think history will answer that question for you.' Unswayed by Patton, Simpson or even Churchill, Eisenhower ordered U.S. forces to halt along the Elbe and Mulde rivers. Thus, these spearheads were practically immobilized while the war raged on for three more weeks.
* Bradley - Simultaneously, General Bradley considered the Germans trapped in the Ruhr Pocket to be the most significant threat and committed surprisingly large numbers of U.S. troops to collapse (as opposed to containing) the pocket instead of reinforcing his troops at the Elbe River. As a consequence of Eisenhower's decision, the British 21st Army Group was ordered to drive northeast in the direction of Hamburg instead of proceeding due east in the direction of Berlin.
* Propaganda - The Allies proved curiously gullible about German propaganda claiming the existence of a 'National Redoubt' in the Alpine hinterlands of Bavaria and Austria. Fearing a large-scale last stand by the Nazis in this so-called redoubt, General Eisenhower directed no less than three field armies to clear southern Germany at a time when the largest groups of German forces stood to the east, not the south, of General Eisenhower's troops. Fortunately for the Allies, the German Army of April 1945 was in no position to exploit troop concentrations and movements of questionable merit.
* Thus, while the Allies enjoyed a great victory, on occasion their prosecution of the campaign afforded their German adversaries opportunities that prolonged the fighting unnecessarily.")))

       "* On August 8, 1940, Benito Mussolini, anxious to link Libya with Italian East Africa and to capture the Suez Canal and the Arabian oilfields, ordered the invasion of Egypt. Italian forces invaded Egypt from their base in Cyrenaica, Libya. This invasion was repulsed later in the year during Operation Compass.
* Initially the Commonwealth forces, under General Archibald Wavell, fought a successful campaign in the desert west of Egypt. While the fighting was taking place in Libya, Axis forces attacked Greece. General Wavell was ordered to halt his advance against the Italian Army in Libya and send troops to Greece. He disagreed with this decision but followed his orders.
* The Allies were unable to stop Greece falling to the Axis forces and before they could retake the initiative in the western desert the German Afrika Korps led by Erwin Rommel had entered the theatre.
  * It would not be until early in 1943, after another year and a half of hard fighting and mixed fortunes, that the Axis forces would be finally driven out of Libya.
* On November 8, 1942, the U.S. had entered the war beginning with amphibious landing in northwest Africa, codenamed Operation Torch, under the Supreme Allied Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower."

           "* According to historian Williamson A. Murray 'The decision to reinforce North Africa was one of the worst of Hitler's blunder: admittedly, it kept the Mediterranean closed for six more months, with a negative impact on the Allied shipping situation, but it placed some of Germany's best troops in an indefensible position from which, like Stalingrad, there would be no escape. Moreover Hitler committed the Luftwaffe to fight a battle of attrition under unfavorable conditions, and it suffered losses that it could not afford.'
* The Axis's desperate gamble had only slowed the inevitable, and the US loss at Kasserine may, paradoxically, have been the best thing that could have happened to them.
   * With North Africa now in Allied hands, plans quickly turned to the invasion of Sicily, and Italy after it.")))

       "* The battles of this campaign were fought between the forces of the British Empire, the British Commonwealth of Nations, and the forces of the Italian Empire.
* The Commonwealth forces included troops from the Sudan, British Somaliland, British East Africa, the Indian Empire, South Africa, Northern Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia, Nyasaland, and British West Africa (Nigeria, Gold Coast, Sierra Leone, and the Gambia). There was even a small commando unit from the British Mandate of Palestine. In addition to the British and Commonwealth forces, there were Ethiopian irregular forces, Free French forces, and Free Belgian forces.
* In November 1940, the British and Commonwealth forces received an incredible intelligence advantage. The government code and cypher school broke the high grade cypher of the Italian Royal Army in East Africa. Later, during the same month, the replacement cypher for the Italian Royal Air Force was broken.
  * From this point on, the commanders knew Italian plans as soon as they were issued."

They drove galleries into the solid rock to protect their troops and to hold ample ammunition and stores. In this mountain fortress, the defenders, under command of Amedeo, Duke of Aosta, thought themselves to be impregnable.
* The 7000 Italian troops were faced by 9000 British troops and 20000 Ethiopian irregulars. A final assault was planned for 15 May, but a fortuitous artillery shell hit an Italian fuel dump and ruptured a vessel containing oil which flowed into the remaining drinking water of the Italian defenders. The lack of drinkable water then forced the Italians to surrender.
* On 18 May, Amedeo, Duke of Aosta surrendered his embattled forces at Amba Alagi and received full military honors. While the Duke of Aosta faced defeat in East Africa, his brother, the Duke of Spoleto was being made the King of Croatia after the successful invasion of Yugoslavia.

      :summary "* Although Southwest Asia was destined to remain a strategic backwater for the duration of World War II, in late 1941 and early 1942 the Allies were not certain that it would remain so. Before the turning points of the Battle of Stalingrad (June 1942 to February, 1943) and the Second Battle of El Alamein (October to November 1942), the fear was that the Germans might attack the area either through Turkey, or via Cyprus into Lebanon; or through defeating of the British in Egypt. If the anticipated attack came through Turkey or Lebanon, then not only could the Axis Powers threaten British controlled Egypt and the strategically important Suez Canal, it would also allow the Germans an alternative route to attack the Soviet Union from Southwest Asia north through the USSR's southern frontiers. In the slightly longer term the British feared independent regimes in the region as well as the possibility that the German might follow in Alexander the Great's footsteps and attack British controlled India from Persia in the west as Japan simultaneously attacked India from the east through Burma."

           "* On August 25, 1941, Britain and Russia launched an invasion of the neutral nation of Iran. The British feared that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company might fall into German hands. The refinery produced 8 million tons of oil and was a crucial part of the Allied war effort. For the Russians, Iran was a country of extreme strategic importance. The Germans were steadily advancing through the Soviet Union and there were few ways for the Allies to get desperately needed American Lend-Lease supplies to the Soviets. With increasing German submarine attacks, as well as heavy ice floes and the coastal ice cap fast rendering convoys to Arkhangelsk impossible, the Trans-Iranian Railway seemed a very attractive route to transport supplies up from the Persian Gulf. The two Allied nations applied pressure on
Iran and the Shah but this led only to increased tensions and pro-German rallies in Tehran. The Shah refused to expel the many German nationals residing in Iran, and denied the use of the railway to the Allies. These conditions prompted Britain and Russia to invade.
* Franklin Roosevelt reassured the Shah by claiming that the British and Soviets had no designs on the itegrity of Iran. However, the Soviets would later back separatist states in the north, while the U.S. and UK would later support the overthrow of the popular and democratically elected Iranian Prime Minister in 1953.
* With this crucial supply route now open to the Soviet Union the Persian Corridor was opened and would provide a massive flow of supplies (over 5 million tons of war materiel) to the Soviets primarily, but also the British in the Middle East.")))

Churchill's proposal had been strongly opposed by the US Chiefs of Staff who understood its importance to British post-war interests in the region but did not feel it aligned with prevailing overall Allied war priorities.

The tank was widely used by the French and the Americans (who, as mentioned, were lent 514) in the latter stages of World War I, after 31 May 1918. The tank was cheap and well-suited for mass production. Indeed, the very production was made a weapon in itself: a goal was set of 12,260 to be produced (4,440 of which in the USA) before the end of 1919.This prospect was one of several factors which drove the German High Command to its decision to launch the massive all-or-nothing offensives in the spring of 1918, which in turn weakened their army so that it collapsed in the summer.

Placing the weapon within this range was entirely a matter of chance and quite unlikely as the target maneuvered evasively during the attack. Most U-boats sunk by depth charges were destroyed by damage accumulated from a long barrage rather than by a single carefully-aimed attack. Many survived hundreds of depth charge detonations over a period of many hours.
* The depth charge causes damage by both the initial shock wave and by the subsequent reverberating shock waves that have a tendency to bend a submarine back and forth cause a hull breach.
* A 100kg of TNT depth charge would have a kill radius of 3-4m. Higher payloads only increase this by a few meters because the effect decreases with the distance cubed. The killing range is also greater with larger submarines. It is doubtful a midget submarine with a titanium hull could be destroyed by anything less than a direct hit."

A battery typically consisted of two groups of 12 rockets and when all 24 were fired at once they would fill an area about 15 by 30 m at 1000 m, dense enough that one was almost certain to hit its target.
