Both the French and German armies suffered incredibly with an estimated 540,000 French and 430,000 German casualties and no strategic advantages were gained for either side.\n* In the years preceding World War I, Germany became Europe's leading industrial power. France felt increasingly threatened by German industrialization. As a response to the German threat of invasion, France built a continuous line of sunken forts from the Swiss frontier to the French city of Verdun making Verdun a vital strong point.\n* The German attack began on February 21, 1916 with an intense artillery bombardment of the forts surrounding Verdun. The French army retreated to predetermined positions while the German army pounded through the French lines.\n* Although three French forts near Verdun had capitulated to German forces, Verdun itself remained undefeated.\n* By April 1916, the French Air Force had secured the sky over Verdun, which would help the French to successfully defend the area. The British attack and a Russian offensive in the east forced the German army to transfer troops away from Verdun.\n* By December 1916, the French had advanced to their February 1916 lines, their original position. No new advantage had been gained for either side."),

Combined with the BEF (British Expeditionary Force) the Germans were eventually halted and the War settled into the familiar defensive series of entrenchment's.\n* Ironically, by the end of May, 1918, the Germans had again reached the Marne after the enormous successes of Ludendorff's offensives of that year. The intervening four years had cost hundreds of thousands of lives and the armies were still, literally, exactly where they had started."),

Here, a combination of over-ambitious aims, appalling weather conditions, and misguided persistence by Haig led to horrific losses. By the time the offensive was called off total casualties for both sides had been approximately 250,000.

This, coupled with the failure of the artillery bombardment to dislodge much of the German wire, or to destroy their machine-gun posts, led to one of the biggest slaughters in military history.\n* After the first day, with a gain of only 1.5km, the British had suffered 57,470 casualties. Despite this, Haig pressed on with the attack until November 19th of the same year. For the meager achievements, total losses on the British and Imperial side numbered 419,654 with German casualties between 450,000 and 680,000.

A surprise artillery barrage started the offensive and 476 tanks, packed tightly for a mass attack moved against the German lines. Supported by infantry the gains were dramatic, breaching the almost impregnable Hindenberg line to depths of 4-5 miles in some places. However, these gains seemed to surprise British High Command equally as much as the Germans, and the following cavalry failed to take advantage. Nevertheless, Cambrai demonstrated how a well-thought out attack, combining tanks en masse with surprise, could be used to break the trench deadlock.")

The FT 17 was the first tank with an armament in a fully rotating turret, and its configuration with the turret on top, engine in the back and the driver in front became the conventional one, repeated in most tanks until today; at the time it was a revolutionary innovation, causing armour historian Steven Zaloga to describe the type as 'the world's first modern tank.' The tank was widely used by the French and the Americans (who, as mentioned, were lent 514) in the latter stages of World War I, after 31 May 1918. The tank was cheap and well-suited for mass production. Indeed, the very production was made a weapon in itself: a goal was set of 12,260 to be produced (4,440 of which in the USA) before the end of 1919.This prospect was one of several factors which drove the German High Command to its decision to launch the massive all-or-nothing offensives in the spring of 1918, which in turn weakened their army so that it collapsed in the summer. FT 17 tanks were also used in the Second World War, among others in Poland, Finland, France and Kingdom of Yugoslavia, although they were completely obsolete by then.")

      "* The battles of this campaign were fought between the forces of the British Empire, the British Commonwealth of Nations, and the forces of the Italian Empire.\n* The Commonwealth forces included troops from the Sudan, British Somaliland, British East Africa, the Indian Empire, South Africa, Northern Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia, Nyasaland, and British West Africa (Nigeria, Gold Coast, Sierra Leone, and the Gambia). There was even a small commando unit from the British Mandate of Palestine. In addition to the British and Commonwealth forces, there were Ethiopian irregular forces, Free French forces, and Free Belgian forces.\n* In November 1940, the British and Commonwealth forces received an incredible intelligence advantage. The government code and cypher school broke the high grade cypher of the Italian Royal Army in East Africa. Later, during the same month, the replacement cypher for the Italian Royal Air Force was broken.\n  * From this point on, the commanders knew Italian plans as soon as they were issued.",

Most of them (about 70%) were local East African askaris. While the askaris of the regular Eritrean battalions of the 'Royal Corps of Colonial Troops' (Regio Corpo Truppe Coloniali) were amongst the best Italian units in East Africa, the majority of the colonial troops were recruited, trained, and equipped to do no more than maintain order in the colony. Ethiopian askaris and irregulars, recruited during the brief Italian occupation, deserted in large numbers after the outbreak of war.\n   * The Royal Corps of Colonial Troops included horse mounted Eritrean cavalry known as 'Falcon Feathers' (Penne di Falcon). On one occasion a squadron of these horsemen charged British and Commonwealth troops throwing small hand grenades from the saddle.\n* The Italian forces were equipped with about 3,300 machine guns, 24 M11/39 tanks, a large number of L3/35 tankettes, 126 armored cars and 813 pieces of assorted artillery. The Italian faced problems with isolation of the East Africa, with very little chance for reinforcements or resupply, leading to problems especially with ammunition.\n* Malaria - It is estimated that nearly one-quarter of the Italians troops defending Amba Alagi in April 1941 had malaria during the siege. Unfortunately, the Italians at Amba Alagi had no medicine for malaria. Even the commander of Amba Alagi, the Duke of Aosta, was himself afflicted with malaria during the siege. He died of tuberculosis and malaria on 3 March 1942, a few months after his surrender.\n* Aircraft - The Italians had 200-300 Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 and Savoia-Marchetti SM.81 bombers and Fiat CR-42 fighters. While some of these aircraft were outdated, in relative terms these were some of the best aircraft available to either side in East Africa in 1940. In addition, the Italian aircraft were often based at better airfields than their British and Commonwealth counter-parts. When the war began, Italian pilots were relatively well trained and confident of their abilities. But, cut off from Italy as they were, problems with lack of fuel, munitions, spare parts, and replacements eventually wore the Italian air capability down.\n* Navy - Italian Naval power maintained presence in the Red Sea region with its 'Red Sea Flotilla' consisting of seven destroyers, five motor torpedo boats and eight submarines."),

The British were slightly better equipped than the Italians, and had access to resupply and reinforcements. However, they were vastly outnumbered by the Italian forces. To make matters worse, the Italians had at least another 208,000 men (fourteen divisions) available in Libya.\n* Gideon Force - A significant aspect of the Allied campaign to retake Ethiopia was an elite group of Ethiopian irregulars called Gideon Force that would tie down large number of Italian units throughout the colony.\n* Aircraft - The roughly one-hundred aircraft available to the British and Commonwealth forces at the beginning of the campaign were dispersed as follows: In the north (Sudan) were two Royal Air Force (RAF) bomber squadrons at Port Sudan (one of these squadron was equipped with obsolete aircraft) and the RAF Army Co-operation Squadron on the Sudan frontier. In the south (Kenya) were No. 12 Bomber Squadron of the South African Air Force (SAAF) (equipped with Junkers Ju 86 bombers), No. 11 Bomber Squadron of the SAAF (equipped with Fairey Battles), No. 40 Army Co-operation Squadron SAAF (equipped with Hawker Hartebees), No. 2 Fighter Squadron, SAAF (equipped with Hawker Furies), and No.\n237 (Southern Rhodesian) Army Co-operation Squadron (equipped with Hawker Hardys). Unlike the Italians, the aircraft available to the British and Commonwealth forces got better with time. But much of the equipment initially available tended to be older and slower. Even so, the British and Commonwealth forces managed to make do with what they had.\n* Navy - Allied Naval presence is very high in the Indian Ocean, but the Eastern Fleet largely consisted of older capital ships that had been deemed too slow or too vulnerable to be of use in the Atlantic Ocean or the Mediterranean Sea."),

The British resisted with 4,000 men including the Somaliland Camel Corp.\n* By August 19, the Italians took control of British Somaliland which was the first British colony to fall to enemy forces in World War II. The Italians, however, had taken nearly 10 times the number of casualties as the British.\n* Winston Churchill, criticized General Archibald Wavell concerning the loss of British Somaliland. Because of the low casualty rate, Churchill fretted that the British had abandoned the colony without enough of a fight. In response to this criticism, Wavell claimed that Somaliland was a textbook withdrawal in the face of superior numbers. He pointed out to Churchill that 'A bloody butcher's bill is not the sign of a good tactician.' According to Churchill's staff, Wavell's retort moved Churchill to greater fury than they had ever seen before.\n* In September, 1940, Indian Infantry Divisions started arriving in the Sudan.\n* Throughout November, December, and early January, the British continued to apply constant pressure on the Italians all along the border with the Sudan. Better British aircraft started to replace some of the\nolder models. The new Hawker Hurricanes were clearly superior to the Italian Fiat CR-42. Additionally, a series of failed naval engagements had lost a number of Italian warships with few British losses.\n* By January, 31 1941, the Italian military forces in East Africa were down to 67 operational aircraft with limited fuel."),

They drove galleries into the solid rock to protect their troops and to hold ample ammunition and stores. In this mountain fortress, the defenders, under command of Amedeo, Duke of Aosta, thought themselves to be impregnable.\n* The 7000 Italian troops were faced by 9000 British troops and 20000 Ethiopian irregulars. A final assault was planned for 15 May, but a fortuitous artillery shell hit an Italian fuel dump and ruptured a vessel containing oil which flowed into the remaining drinking water of the Italian defenders. The lack of drinkable water then forced the Italians to surrender.\n* On 18 May, Amedeo, Duke of Aosta surrendered his embattled forces at Amba Alagi and received full military honors. While the Duke of Aosta faced defeat in East Africa, his brother, the Duke of Spoleto was being made the King of Croatia after the successful invasion of Yugoslavia. The Duke of Aosta had endured the last months of fighting while suffering a severe attack of malaria (and died of TBC and malaria a few months later).")

Over 4.5 million troops of the Axis powers invaded the USSR along an 1,800 mile front. The operation was named after the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa of the Holy Roman Empire, a leader of the Third Crusade in the 12th century. Barbarossa was the major part of the war on the Eastern Front. The planning for operation Barbarossa took several years prior to June 1941; the clandestine preparations and the military operation itself lasted almost a year, from the Spring of 1941, through the Winter of 1941.\n* The operational goal of Operation Barbarossa was the rapid conquest of the European part of the Soviet Union, west of a line connecting the cities of Arkhangelsk and Astrakhan, often referred to as the A-A line (see the translation of Hitler's directive for details). At its conclusion in December 1941, the Red Army had repelled the strongest blow of the Wehrmacht. Hitler had not achieved the victory he had expected, but the situation of the Soviet Union remained critical. Tactically the Germans had won some resounding victories and occupied some of the most important economic areas of the country, most notably in Ukraine. Despite these successes, the Germans were pushed back from Moscow and were not able to mount an offensive simultaneously along the entire strategic Soviet-German front again.\n* Then the failure of Barbarossa resulted in Hitler's demands for additional operations inside Russia, all of which eventually failed, such as continuation of the Siege of Leningrad, Operation Nordlicht, and Battle of Stalingrad, among other battles on the occupied Russian territory.\n* The failure of Operation Barbarossa resulted in the eventual defeat of Nazi Germany and is considered a turning point for the Third Reich. Most importantly, Operation Barbarossa opened up the Eastern Front, which ultimately became the biggest theater of war in world history. Operation Barbarossa and the areas which fell under it became the site of some of the largest and most brutal battles, deadliest atrocities, terrible loss of life, and horrific conditions for Soviets and Germans alike - all of which influenced the course of both WWII and 20th Century history."),

The elimination of Italy as an enemy would also enable the Royal Navy to completely dominate the Mediterranean Sea, massively improving communications with Egypt, the Far East, the Middle East, and India. It would also mean that the Germans would have to transfer troops from the Eastern Front to defend Italy and the entire southern coast of France, thus aiding the Soviets.

        vx_core.f_new({"any-1": nx_tactics_base.t_section}, ":name", "Turning Points of the War", ":summary", "* While the unconditional surrender of German armed forces represented a resounding Allied success, in retrospect, it is clear that particular factors and choices strongly affected the pace and course of the campaign.\n* D-Day - The Allied deception as to where the D-Day landings would take place was very successful, with the majority of the German command convinced the landings would take place at Calais. The Germans underestimated Allied willingness to risk an amphibious assault over a route longer than the shortest path across the English Channel.\n* Hedgerows - While the Allies meticulously planned the D-Day landings, they failed to assess the countryside immediately beyond the beaches, which resulted in the Germans very successfully using the hedgerow country as a system of natural defensive works that took the Allies two months to clear at a staggering cost in infantry casualties. Historians have also asserted the U.S. Army should have landed on the eastern end of the Normandy beaches and formed the northern wing of Allied forces in Northwest Europe because the mobility of American forces could have been better used in the more open terrain and most direct route to Berlin that the northern approach offered. As it was, the pre-invasion basing of troops in England determined the arrangement of the landing forces.\n* Underestimation - While the Germans had reason to occasionally doubt Allied military proficiency, it is clear the Germans too often underestimated Allied competency. This habit of underestimation led to the rejection of any notion that the Allies might have broken German military ciphers, most famously the Enigma code. The ability to monitor German military communications was an Allied strategic asset of the highest order. Less dramatically, the Germans often underestimated Allied troop proficiency, a habit that resulted in occasional sharp defeats for overconfident German units.\n* Manpower - The German ability to form a cohesive defensive line after the disaster their forces endured in Normandy was due almost entirely to the ability of the German Ersatzheer (Replacement Army) to quickly deploy large numbers of new troops. These inexperienced troops were paired with seasoned cadres who swiftly transformed the replacements into combat units. Thus, while the Allies took large numbers of German prisoners during their advance from Normandy to the German border, they  underestimated the ability of the Germans to reconstitute their forces under very disadvantageous circumstances. The Allies also seriously underestimated the infantry casualties their forces would suffer in Northwestern Europe. Shortages of American manpower were strongly aggravated by a tendency to attack head-on regardless of circumstances, a habit that was particularly in evidence during the months of fighting in the Huertgen Forest. The Allied logistical crisis that dominated their operations from September through December had the further pernicious effect of limiting the number of divisions in England that could be moved onto the continent to reinforce the front, since the Allies were only able to supply a limited number of divisions east of the Seine River. After the Allies mastered the logistical crisis, the Americans diverted divisions bound for the Pacific Theater to Europe in a belated realization that more divisions were needed for operations in Europe.\n* German Strategic Errors - While the Germans achieved strategic surprise with their offensive in the Ardennes, the Panzer divisions that had been so painstakingly rebuilt could have been more profitably used to defend the Siegfried Line and the Rhineland, or perhaps, in the defense of Berlin against the Red Army. The German thrust failed to shatter their enemies' alliance and cost Germany high casualties and equipment losses it could ill-afford. This folly was repeated in Alsace in January, but with the added disadvantage this time that the Allies were expecting the attack.\n* American Strategic Errors - Upon breaking out of Normandy in August, the Americans committed two armored divisions to operations in Brittany when armored units were direly needed for the pursuit of the German army across France. While the port of Brest, France was ultimately captured by the Americans, it consumed operations for an entire month and ultimately did little for the Allied effort because the Germans so thoroughly destroyed the port before it was captured. Out of fear that two wings of their forces might collide, the Allies failed to definitively close the Falaise Gap in August, allowing trapped German forces an escape route to the east. Experienced German leadership cadres evaded Allied forces and were available to reconstitute a cohesive front line along the Siegfried Line.\n* Antwerp - Although British forces conducted a brilliant pursuit across northern France that resulted in the liberation of the critically important port of Antwerp in early September, they failed to promptly clear the Scheldt Estuary of Germans. The Germans immediately grasped the significance of the Scheldt Estuary and moved in troops to conduct a lengthy defense. The port of Antwerp could not be used until November 28, and strongly contributed to the lengthy logistical crisis that hamstrung Allied operations for four months.\n* Operation Market-Garden was a double failure in the sense that the resources used for it would have been more profitably committed to clearing the Scheldt Estuary instead of carving out an extended salient that did nothing but extend an already over-extended Allied front line.\n* Siegfreid Line - Despite grave shortages of riflemen, American operations in front of the Siegfried Line, particularly in U.S. First Army's area, were characterized by bloody frontal assaults. Stubbornness and misplaced notions that the U.S. Army could not allow itself to abandon unprofitable operations saw five infantry divisions shredded in the Huertgen Forest fighting, with the attack being abandoned only in December after the Germans attacked into the Ardennes. The concentration of divisions in the Huertgen Forest also forced a corresponding lack of concentration along the Ardennes front, with the result that only four U.S. divisions were initially available to parry a 26 division German offensive.\n* Eisenhower - When, in November, the Allies enjoyed significant success in 6th Army Group's area, General Eisenhower refused to reinforce the success and even forbade his commanders in the south to attempt to assault across the Rhine in the area of Strasbourg while the German defenses were in shambles. This lack of bold enterprise was a by-product of General Eisenhower's decision to conduct limited-objective attacks on a broad front even though the Allies lacked a sufficient number of divisions to both man a broad front and concentrate enough combat power in chosen areas to achieve breakthroughs. When American troops reached the Elbe River in mid-April, General Eisenhower unilaterally decided that Berlin was no longer a significant military objective. He knew that Berlin would be deep within the Soviet zone of post-war Germany and saw no reason to fight for land that would have to be given to the Soviets after the war. Eisenhower pointed out to Patton that it was of no military strategic value and would take up a lot of resources to occupy and asked Patton 'Who would want it?' Patton replied 'I think history will answer that question for you.' Unswayed by Patton, Simpson or even Churchill, Eisenhower ordered U.S. forces to halt along the Elbe and Mulde rivers. Thus, these spearheads were practically immobilized while the war raged on for three more weeks.\n* Bradley - Simultaneously, General Bradley considered the Germans trapped in the Ruhr Pocket to be the most significant threat and committed surprisingly large numbers of U.S. troops to collapse (as opposed to containing) the pocket instead of reinforcing his troops at the Elbe River. As a consequence of Eisenhower's decision, the British 21st Army Group was ordered to drive northeast in the direction of Hamburg instead of proceeding due east in the direction of Berlin.\n* Propaganda - The Allies proved curiously gullible about German propaganda claiming the existence of a 'National Redoubt' in the Alpine hinterlands of Bavaria and Austria. Fearing a large-scale last stand by the Nazis in this so-called redoubt, General Eisenhower directed no less than three field armies to clear southern Germany at a time when the largest groups of German forces stood to the east, not the south, of General Eisenhower's troops. Fortunately for the Allies, the German Army of April 1945 was in no position to exploit troop concentrations and movements of questionable merit.\n* Thus, while the Allies enjoyed a great victory, on occasion their prosecution of the campaign afforded their German adversaries opportunities that prolonged the fighting unnecessarily.")

Drinking water was distributed only twice per day, but the constant bombing and shelling often interrupted the ration. When the bombardment killed the mules in the Cavalry, they would drag the carcasses down to the mess hall and cook them.\n* Japanese aircraft flew 614 missions dropping 1,701 bombs totaling some 365 tons of explosive.",

It demonstrated that the Japanese home islands were vulnerable to Allied air attack. The Doolittle Raid was the only time that United States Army Air Forces bombers were launched from an aircraft carrier.\n* The plan was to launch B-25B bombers from a carrier, hit targets in Japan, and fly on to land in China. All 16 aircraft were lost, and 11 crewmen were either killed or captured.

The raid also had a strategic impact, though it was not understood at the time, in that it caused the Japanese to recall some fighter units back to the home islands for defense. They did not understand how American aircraft could attack from such a distance and assumed that America had developed a new, extremely long-range aircraft, when in reality, American forces knew it would essentially be a one-way trip. This assumption that the home islands were vulnerable to air attack strengthened Admiral Yamamoto's resolve to carry out military action against Midway Island.

          "* On May 4-8, 1942, the Japanese fought the US and Australian in the first naval battle between aircraft carriers and the first naval battle where neither side's ships sighted or fired directly upon the other.\n* On May 6, 1942, land-based B-17s attacked the approaching Port Moresby invasion fleet with the usual lack of success. Almost another year would pass before the USAAF realized high-altitude bombing attacks against moving naval targets were pointless. That night the commander at Port Moresby made the difficult decision to detach his main surface force (3 cruisers and 3 destroyers) to block the probable course of an invasion. He risked a repeat of the loss of HMS Prince of Wales and Repulse by exposing surface ships to attack by land-based aircraft without air cover. Indeed, his cruisers were spotted and came under an intense air attack from torpedo bombers but escaped with little damage. Only minutes after the Japanese raid, his force was inadvertently attacked by friendly B-17s and once again had to\nendure near misses.\n* On May 7, 1942, U.S. aircraft, sent in the wrong direction by a miscoded contact report, had missed Sh�?kaku and Zuikaku but found the invasion fleet, escorted by the small carrier Sh�?h�?, which was soon sunk with heavy casualties. In the previous five months the Allies had lost numerous major warships and had been unable to sink a single major Japanese ship in return. Sh�?h�? was small by carrier standards, but the phrase 'scratch one flattop,' announced the first Allied naval success of the Pacific War.\n* On May 8, 1942, the main carrier forces located one another and launched full raids, which passed each other in the air. Sh�?kaku was hit three times by bombs. Her deck damaged, Sh�?kaku was unable to land her aircraft and was thus effectively put out of action. Both American carriers were hit: Yorktown by a bomb; the Lexington, by both bombs and torpedoes. Lexington had to be abandoned and sunk to prevent her capture.\n* Tactically, the Japanese had achieved a narrow victory; one small carrier lost and a large carrier severely damaged against the Americans' loss of a large carrier and significant damage to another. But from the Allied point of view, after five months of continuous defeat, a battle that came out almost even was close enough to a victory.\n* Strategically, the Allies had won since the invasion of Port Moresby, New Guinea had been averted (the first time the Japanese had been turned back). With Sh�?kaku damaged and Zuikaku short of aircraft, neither was able to take part in the crucial Battle of Midway a month later. The loss of Lexington was a severe blow as she was one of the Navy's largest carriers. The damaged Yorktown returned to Pearl Harbor and although her damage was estimated to require months in port, she was made more or less battle-worthy in a miracle of improvisation and determination in just 2 days.",

          "* From June 4, 1942 to June 7, 1942, exactly six months to the day after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor the Americans and Japanese fought around Midway island in what is widely regarded as the most important naval battle in the Pacific.\n* For months, bureaucratic infighting delayed Admiral Yamamoto's plans in the Pacific. In the end, his threat to resign succeeded in moving his agenda forward. Yamamoto's primary strategic concern was the elimination of America's remaining carrier forces. Midway was not especially important, but the Japanese felt that the Americans would strongly defend it. The Japanese believed that only the USS Enterprise and Hornet would be available since the Lexington had been sunk and the Yorktown was badly damaged. Yamamoto dispersed his fleet to deceive the U.S. so the full extent of his fleet was hidden, but the U.S. had broken the Japanese naval code which negated this strategy and left his fleets separated by several hundred miles.\n* In order to battle 4 or 5 carriers, Admiral Nimitz needed every available carrier, so the Yorktown was restored to battle-worthy state in 72 hours. Repairs continued even as Yorktown sortied.\n* A picket line of Japanese submarines was late getting into position (partly because of Yamamoto's haste), which let the American carriers proceed to their assembly point without being detected. Reconnaissance planes were supposed to scout Pearl Harbor prior to the battle to detect American carriers. This plan was also thwarted when the refueling submarines found the refuelling point occupied by American warships (because the Japanese had carried out an identical mission in March). Thus, Japan was deprived of any knowledge concerning the movements of the American carriers. Japanese radio intercepts noticed an increase in both American submarine activity and message traffic. Yamamoto, at sea in Yamato, did not dare inform Nagumo for fear of exposing his position, and presumed (incorrectly)\nNagumo had received the same message from Tokyo.\n* Admiral Nimitz had one priceless asset: American and British cryptanalysts had broken the JN-25 code, confirming Midway as the target, determining the date of the attack, and providing a complete IJN order of battle. Japan's efforts to introduce a new codebook had been delayed, giving HYPO several crucial days.\n* Nimitz was aware, for example, the vast numerical superiority of the Japanese fleet had been divided into no less than four task forces, and the escort for the main Carrier Striking Force was limited to just a few fast ships. For this reason, they knew the anti-aircraft guns protecting the carriers would be limited. Nimitz calculated his three carriers, plus Midway island, to Yamamoto's four, gave the U.S. rough parity. Meanwhile, the Japanese remained almost totally in the dark even after the battle began.\n* On June 4, nine B-17s operating from Midway attacked the Japanese transport group, but no significant damage was sustained.\n* On June 4, 4:30, Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo launched an attack wave (108 aircraft). At the same time, he launched eight search aircraft (one 30 minutes late due to technical issues).\n* American radar picked up the enemy at a distance of several miles and interceptors soon scrambled. Unescorted bombers headed off to attack the Japanese carrier fleet, their fighter escorts remaining behind to defend Midway.\n* At 06:20, Japanese carrier aircraft bombed and heavily damaged the U.S. base on Midway. Midway-based obsolescent F4F Wildcats, defended Midway and suffered heavy losses. Most were downed in the first few minutes. The Japanese learned the island's bombers had already departed, and the strike leader signaled Nagumo another attack would be necessary to neutralize Midway's defenses before troops could be landed.\n* American anti-aircraft fire was accurate and intense, damaging many Japanese aircraft and claiming a third of the Japanese planes destroyed.\n* American bombers based on Midway made several torpedo attacks on the Japanese carrier fleet, but the Japanese shrugged off these attacks with almost no losses, destroying all but three of the American bombers.\n* At 7:15, As a result of the attacks from Midway, Nagumo ordered his reserve planes to be re-armed with bombs for use on land targets. 30 minutes later a scout plane signaled the discovery of a sizable American naval force to the east. Nagumo quickly reversed his order and demanded the scout plane ascertain the composition of the American force. Another 40 minutes elapsed before Tone's scout finally detected and radioed the presence of a single carrier in the American force, TF 16 (the other carrier was not detected).\n* Nagumo was now in a quandary. His opportunity to hit the American ships was curtailed by the fact his Midway strike force would be returning shortly. They would be low on fuel and carrying wounded crewmen, would need to land promptly or ditch, losing precious aircraft and crews; there was slim chance a strike could be mounted in time. Spotting his flight decks and launching aircraft would require at least 30-45 minutes, but if he launched immediately his bombers would be without fighter escort and they had just witnessed how easily unescorted American bombers were shot down by their own fighters.\n* In the end, Nagumo chose to wait for his first strike force to land, then launch the reserve force. In the final analysis, it made no difference; Fletcher had launched beginning at 07:00, so the aircraft which would deliver the crushing blow were already on their way. There was nothing Nagumo could do about it. This was the fatal flaw of Yamamoto's dispositions: it followed strictly traditional battleship doctrine.\n* It was at this point Spruance gave his second crucial command, to run toward the target, having judged that the need to throw something at the enemy as soon as possible was greater than the need for a coordinated attack. Accordingly, American squadrons were launched piecemeal, proceeding to the target in several different groups. This diminished the overall impact of the American attacks and greatly increased their casualties; coincidentally, it reduced the Japanese ability to counterstrike and found Nagumo with his decks at their most vulnerable.\n* At 9:20, Allied planes began attacking, led by Torpedo Squadron 8 (VT-8, from Hornet), followed by VT-6 (from Enterprise). Every TBD Devastator of VT-8 was shot down, with only one survivor. VT-6 squadron met nearly the same fate, with no hits against the enemy, thanks in part to terrible aircraft torpedoes. The Japanese combat air patrol, flying the much faster Zero, made short work of the Americans, who not only had no fighter support but were flying the slow, under-armed TBDs.\n* The appearance of a third torpedo plane attack from the southeast by VT-3 at 10:00 very quickly drew the majority of the Japanese CAP into the southeast quadrant of the fleet. By chance, at the same time VT-3 was sighted by the Japanese, two separate formations (comprising three squadrons total) of American SBD Dauntless dive-bombers were approaching the Japanese fleet from the northeast and southwest. These formations initially had difficulty in locating the Japanese carriers, and their fuel was running low. However, by the decisions of squadron commanders C. Wade McClusky, Jr. and Max Leslie to continue the search, they spotted the wake of Japanese destroyer Arashi. The destroyer was steaming at full speed back to Nagumo's carrier force, after having unsuccessfully depth-charged the U.S. submarine Nautilus.\n* The American dive-bombers arrived in a perfect position to attack the Japanese. Armed Japanese strike aircraft filled the hangar decks at the time of the fateful attack, fuel hoses were snaking across the decks as refueling operations were hastily completed, and the constant change of ordnance meant bombs and torpedoes were stacked around the hangars rather than stowed safely in the magazines. The Japanese carriers were extraordinarily vulnerable.\n* Contrary to some accounts of the battle, contemporary research, based on recent translation of relevant portions of the 100 volume Japanese account of the war, has demonstrated that the Japanese were not in fact prepared to launch a counterstrike when they were decisively attacked. Because of the constant flight deck activity associated with combat air patrol operations, the Japanese had never had an opportunity to spot their reserve for launch. The few aircraft on the Japanese flight decks at the time of the attack were either CAP fighters, or (in the case of S�?ryū) strike fighters being spotted to augment the CAP.\n* At 10:22, Enterprise's aircraft attacked Kaga, while to the south, Yorktown's aircraft attacked carrier S�?ryū, with Akagi being struck by several of Enterprise's bombers four minutes later. Simultaneously, VT-3 was targeting Hiryū, although the American torpedo aircraft again scored no hits. Within six minutes, the SBD dive bombers made their attack runs and left all three of their targets heavily ablaze. Akagi was hit by just one bomb, which was sufficient; it penetrated to the upper hangar deck and exploded among the armed and fueled aircraft there. One extremely near miss also slanted in and exploded underwater, bending the flight deck upward with the resulting geyser and causing crucial rudder damage. S�?ryū took three bomb hits in the hangar decks; Kaga took at least four. All three carriers were out of action and were eventually abandoned and scuttled.\n* By proceeding to target directly, without waiting for fighter escort, the torpedo squadrons, one after another, at low level, engaged enemy combat air patrol. This created an opportunity for the pilots of the dive bombers, who had arrived high above the action and were able to dive on target before being attacked. The torpedo planes were shot down and the torpedo squadron pilots lost their lives, but they enabled a titanic victory.\n   * Hiryū, the sole surviving Japanese aircraft carrier, wasted little time in counterattacking. The first wave of Japanese dive-bombers badly damaged Yorktown with two bomb hits, yet her damage control teams patched her up so effectively (in about an hour) the second wave's torpedo bombers mistook her for an intact carrier. After two torpedo hits, Yorktown lost power and was out of the battle, forcing Admiral Fletcher to move his flag to the heavy cruiser Astoria.\n* Hiryū recovered its aircraft and prepared for a strike against what was believed to be the only remaining American carrier.\n* Enterprise launched a final strike of dive bombers (including 10 bombers from Yorktown), leaving Hiryū ablaze, despite being defended by a strong defensive CAP of over a dozen Zero fighters. Rear Admiral Yamaguchi chose to go down with his ship, costing Japan perhaps her best carrier sailor.\n* In the night, the fleets did not encounter one another which may have been fortunate for the Americans, for had the US carrier fleet come in contact with Yamamoto's heavies, including Yamato, in the dark, the US cruisers would have been overwhelmed, and the carriers helpless.\n* On June 7, Yorktown was sunk during salvage efforts, by three torpedoes from Japanese submarine I-168. There were few casualties since most of the crew had already been evacuated. One torpedo from this salvo also sank the destroyer USS Hammann, which had been providing auxiliary power to Yorktown, splitting her in two.\n* The battle was a decisive victory for the Americans, dealing Japanese naval aviation a heavy blow. The pre-war Japanese training program produced pilots of exceptional quality but at a slow rate. This small group of elite aviators were combat hardened veterans. At Midway, the Japanese lost as many of these pilots in a single day as their training program produced in a year. By mid-1943, Japanese naval aviation was decimated. Even more important was the irredeemable loss of four of Japan's fleet carriers. These ships were not replaced until early in 1945. In the same span of time, the U.S. Navy commissioned more than two dozen fleet and light fleet carriers.",

              ":summary",
              "* On November 12-15, 1942, the decisive battle was fought during the months long Guadalcanal Campaign. The Japanese organized a transport convoy to take 7,000 infantry troops and their equipment to Guadalcanal to attempt once again to retake Henderson Field airfield. To allow the convoy to approach the island and deliver its cargo, the Japanese navy sent several warship forces to bombard Henderson Field with the goal of destroying Allied aircraft. Learning of the Japanese reinforcement effort, U.S. forces prepared to interdict the Japanese convoy and warships with aircraft and warship attacks.\n* At 1:25 on November 13, 1942 in almost pitch darkness both fleets entered the sound between Savo Island and Guadalcanal. Several of the U.S. ships detected the Japanese ships on radar, but had trouble communicating the information because of problems with their ship's radio equipment and lack of discipline with their communications procedures. Several minutes later, both forces visually sighted each other about the same time. At 01:48, Akatsuki and Hiei turned on large searchlights and lit up Atlanta only 3,000 yards (2.7 km) away—almost point-blank range for large naval artillery. Several of the ships on both sides spontaneously opened fire. As the ships from the two sides intermingled, they battled each other in an utterly confused and chaotic melée at close distances. Afterwards, an officer on Monssen likened it to 'a barroom brawl after the lights had been shot out'\n* At least six of the U.S. ships, including Laffey, O'Bannon, Atlanta, San Francisco, Portland, and Helena, fired at Akatsuki, which drew attention to herself with her illuminated searchlight. Akatsuki was hit repeatedly and blew up and sank within a few minutes.\n* Perhaps because it was the lead cruiser in the U.S. formation, Atlanta was the target of fire from several Japanese ships. It suffered heavy damage and drifted into the line of fire of San Francisco, which accidentally fired on Atlanta, causing even greater damage, and killing Admiral Scott and much of the bridge crew.\n* Hiei, with her nine lit searchlights, huge size, and course taking her directly through the U.S. formation, became the focus of gunfire from many of the U.S. ships. Laffey passed so close to Hiei that they missed colliding by 20 feet (6m). Hiei was unable to depress her main or secondary batteries low enough to hit Laffey, but Laffey was able to rake Hiei's superstructure with 5-inch (130 mm) shells and machine gun fire, causing heavy damage to Hiei's superstructure and bridge, wounding Admiral Abe, and killing his chief of staff.\n* Unable to fire her main or secondary batteries at the three destroyers causing her so much trouble, Hiei instead concentrated on San Francisco which was passing by only 2,500 yards (2.3 km) away.[42] Along with Kirishima, Inazuma, and Ikazuchi, the four ships made repeated hits on San Francisco, disabling her steering control and killing Admiral Callaghan, Captain Cassin Young, and most of the bridge staff. The first few salvos from Hiei and Kirishima consisted of the special fragmentation bombardment shells, which reduced damage to the interior of San Francisco and may have saved her from being sunk outright. Not expecting a ship-to-ship confrontation, it took the crews of the two Japanese battleships several minutes to switch to armor-piercing ammunition.\n* Two of the U.S. destroyers met a sudden demise. Either Nagara or the destroyers Teruzuki and Yukikaze came upon the drifting Cushing and pounded her with gunfire, knocking out all of her systems. Unable to fight back, Cushing's crew abandoned ship. Cushing sank several hours later. Laffey, having escaped from her engagement with Hiei, encountered Asagumo, Murasame, Samidare, and, perhaps, Teruzuki. The Japanese destroyers pounded the Laffey with gunfire and then hit her with a torpedo which broke her keel. A few minutes later fires reached her ammunition magazines and she blew up and sank. Two torpedoes from Amatsukaze hit Barton, immediately sinking her with heavy loss of life. She was accosted by Asagumo, Murasame, and Samidare who had just finished blasting Laffey. They proceeded to smother Monssen with gunfire, damaging her severely and forcing the crew to abandon ship. The ship sank sometime later.\n   * At 2:26, after nearly 40 minutes of the brutal, close-quarters fighting, the two sides broke contact.\n   * The Japanese had one battleship, one light cruiser, and four destroyers that could continue fighting. The U.S. had only one light cruiser, and one destroyer that were still capable of effective resistance. Although perhaps unclear, the way was clear for the Japanese to bombard Henderson Field and finish off the U.S. naval forces in the area, clearing the way for the troops and supplies to be landed safely on Guadalcanal. However, at this crucial juncture, the Japanese chose to abandon the mission.\n   * After the battle, Juneau was torpedoed and sunk by Japanese submarine I-26. Juneau's 100+ survivors (out of a total complement of 650) were left to fend on their own in the open ocean for eight days before rescue aircraft belatedly arrived. While awaiting rescue, all but 10 of Juneau's crew died from their injuries, the elements, or shark attacks.\n   * Because of the confused nature of the battle, the U.S. believed that they had sunk as many as seven Japanese ships. This, plus the Japanese retreat, caused the U.S. to believe at the time that they had won a significant victory. It was only after the war that the U.S. learned that they had suffered what most see as a crushing tactical defeat.\n   * Nevertheless, most historians appear to agree that Abe's decision to retreat turned this tactical defeat into a strategic victory for the U.S. Henderson Field remained operational with attack aircraft ready to deter the slow Japanese transports from approaching Guadalcanal with their precious cargoes. Plus, the Japanese had lost an opportunity to eliminate the U.S. naval forces in the area, a result which would have taken even the comparatively resource-rich U.S. some time to recover from. Reportedly furious, Admiral Yamamoto relieved Abe of command and later directed his forced retirement from the military.\n   * Both sides lost numerous warships in two extremely destructive nighttime surface engagements, with the U.S. suffering more warships sunk or heavily damaged than the Japanese. The U.S., however, was successful in turning back attempts by the Japanese to bombard Henderson Field with battleships. Air attacks by Allied aircraft also sank most of the Japanese troop transports and prevented the majority of the Japanese troops and equipment from reaching Guadalcanal. The battle turned back Japan's last major attempt to dislodge Allied forces from Guadalcanal and nearby Tulagi, resulting in a strategic victory for the U.S. and its allies and deciding the ultimate outcome of the Guadalcanal campaign in favor of Allied forces.",

              "* On the night of November 14-15, 1942, to cover the unloading of the transports at Guadalcanal, the Japanese fleet made its third attempt to neutralize Henderson Field, sending the force of warships through Indispensable Strait to bombard Guadalcanal.\n* Low on undamaged ships, the U.S., detached a scratch force; the new battleships had only operated together for a few days, and their four escorts were from four different divisions—chosen simply because, of the available destroyers, they had the most fuel.\n* At 23:22 The U.S. destroyers in the front of the column engaged Nagara, Ayanami, and 4 destroyers. The Japanese responded effectively with accurate gunfire and torpedoes, and destroyers Walke and Preston were hit and sunk within 10 minutes with heavy loss of life. The destroyer Benham had part of her bow blown off by a torpedo and had to retreat (she sank the next day), and destroyer Gwin was hit in her engine room and put out of the fight. However, the U.S. destroyers had completed their mission as screens for the battleships, absorbing the initial impact of contact with the enemy, although at great cost. Washington passed through the area still occupied by the damaged and sinking U.S. destroyers and fired on Ayanami with her secondary batteries, setting her afire. Following close behind, South Dakota suddenly suffered a series of electrical failures, reportedly during repairs when her chief engineer locked down a circuit breaker in violation of safety procedures, causing her circuits repeatedly to go into series, making her radar, radios, and most of her gun batteries inoperable.\n* At 00:00 on November 15, 1942, almost blind and unable to effectively fire her main and secondary armament, South Dakota was illuminated by searchlights and targeted by gunfire and torpedoes by most of the ships of the Japanese force, including Kirishima. Although able to score a few hits on Kirishima, South Dakota took 25 medium and one large-caliber hit, some of which did not explode, that completely knocked out her communications and remaining gunfire control operations, set portions of her upper decks on fire, and forced her to try to steer away from the engagement.\n* The Japanese ships continued to concentrate their fire on South Dakota and none detected Washington approaching to within 9,000 yards (8 km). Washington was tracking a large target (Kirishima) for some time but refrained from firing since there was a chance it could be South Dakota. Washington had not been able to track South Dakota's movements because she was in a blind spot in the Washington's radar and Lee could not raise her on the radio to confirm her position. When the Japanese illuminated and fired on South Dakota, all doubts were removed as to which ships were friend or foe. From this close range, Washington opened fire and quickly hit Kirishima with at least nine main battery shells and almost forty secondary ones, causing heavy damage and setting her aflame. Kirishima was hit below the waterline and suffered a jammed rudder, causing her to circle uncontrollably to port.\n* Washington then withdrew to draw the Japanese away from the South Dakota. Kirishima and Ayanami were scuttled in the night. At 4:00, the four Japanese transports beached themselves to quickly unload their reinforcements and cargo, but at 5:55 they were attacked by U.S. aircraft from Henderson Field and from field artillery which destroyed most of the ammunition and food supplies that had not yet been unloaded.\n* The failure to deliver most of the troops and supplies in the convoy to Guadalcanal prevented the Japanese from launching another offensive to retake Henderson Field.\n* By late December 1942, the U.S. was able to land 2 fresh divisions of infantry.\n* On December 31, 1942, the Japanese abandoned Guadalcanal.",

Okinawa was to serve as a springboard for the invasion of Japan, though the the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki caused Japan to surrender just weeks after the end of the fighting at Okinawa and the invasion never took place.\n* Some military historians believe that Okinawa led directly to the use of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. '...because the Japanese on Okinawa, including native Okinawans, were so fierce in their defense (even when cut off, and without supplies), and because casualties were so appalling, many American strategists looked for an alternative means to subdue mainland Japan. This means presented itself, with the advent of atomic bombs, which worked admirably in convincing the Japanese to sue for peace, without American casualties. Ironically, the American conventional fire-bombing of major Japanese cities (which had been going on for months before Okinawa) was far more effective at killing civilians than the atomic bombs and, had the Americans simply continued, or expanded this, the Japanese would likely have surrendered anyway. Nevertheless, the bombs were a powerful symbolic display of American power, and the Japanese capitulated, obviating the need for an invasion.'"),

The Bismarck was about to escape under German Air cover, so all British hopes were now pinned on the  aircraft-carrier Ark Royal, the old battlecruiser Renown and the cruiser Sheffield.\n* At dusk that evening, and in atrocious weather conditions, Ark Royal launched its Fairey Swordfish. The first wave mistakenly targeted the Sheffield that was by now shadowing the quarry. Although precious time was lost by this incident, it proved beneficial to the British in that the magnetic detonators on the torpedoes used against Sheffield were seen to be defective and for the following attack on Bismarck were replaced by those designed to explode on contact.\n* In a final attack, almost in darkness at 21:05, a hit by a single torpedo jammed Bismarck's rudder and steering gear. This rendered Bismarck virtually unmanoeuvrable, increased her list to port and she was able only to steam in a large circle.\n    * Throughout that night, Bismarck was the target of incessant torpedo attacks by Tribal-class\ndestroyers. Both Ark Royal and King George V had a lucky escape during the night. The British ships were unaware they had come within firing range of U-556. However, U-556 was returning from a combat patrol and had spent its torpedoes. This was particularly galling as U-556 and Bismarck had exercised together in the Baltic, Bismarck was dubbed the submarine's 'bigger brother'.\n* The Rodney and King George V began bombardment of the crippled Bismarck. It continued to fire back, but in its crippled state it was an easy target. Within 44 minutes, Bismarck's heavy guns were all silent. Rodney now closed to point-blank range (approximately three km) to pound the superstructure, while King George V fired from further out.\n    * With no sign of surrender, despite the unequal struggle, the British were loath to leave Bismarck.\nTheir fuel and shell supplies were low, a demonstration of how difficult it was for a battleship to sink a similar unit, even in an unbalanced engagement. 3 more torpedoes were launched at close range and on the Bismarck the order was given to scuttle the ship.\n    * Dorsetshire and Maori stopped to rescue survivors, but a U-boat alarm caused them to leave the scene after rescuing only 110 Bismarck sailors, abandoning the surviving crew in the water.\n    * The next morning U-74, which had heard sinking noises from a distance, and the German weather ship Sachsenwald picked up 5 survivors. 1,995 of the 2,200 crew were lost.",

Commandos would then destroy other dock structures and fight their way out. The loss of the St. Nazaire as a dry dock would force any large German warship in need of repairs to return to home waters.\n* The Cambeltown was given cosmetic modifications so that she would resemble a German Mowe class destroyer. The diversionary bombing did little except to alert the German forces that something odd was happening. Despite this the British ships got very close to the harbour without being fired on. Rather than use the deep channel which passed near the German guns, Cambeltown used the spring tide to pass over shallows, being lightened by removing guns, etc, though this also affected her handling characteristics.\n   * The force was first noticed at 01:15 but searchlights did not go on until 01:22 when the force was little more than 1.5 nautical miles (2.8 km) from the harbor. The British legitimately flew the Kriegsmarine ensign as a false flag and used a German morse call sign and gained almost five minutes of unimpeded progress. Twice the German guns opened fire but were soon silenced by reassuring coded messages.\n   * It was not until 01:28 with less than a mile to the harbor that the German guns opened fire. The Campbeltown drew most fire but despite a number of casualties struck the southern caisson at around 20 knots (37 km/h) at 01:34, jamming herself deep into the structure and crumpling almost 40 feet (12 m) of her hull. The delay fuses had been set shortly before the ship came under fire.\n   * The seven Commando teams then disembarked and made for their targets.\n* The seventeen smaller vessels, although receiving less fire, were much more vulnerable. In the four minutes around the ramming by the Campbeltown eight of the launches were destroyed in the channel. A few hits were often sufficient to set the motor launches ablaze and the crew and Commandos had to abandon themselves to the water or Carley rafts. Many drowned or were caught in the burning fuel that spread across the water. Most of the eight craft destroyed suffered greater than 80% fatalities, even on the surviving craft barely a man escaped injury.\n* MTB 74 survived, fired her special torpedoes into the lock at the old entrance and made it back out to sea after taking on around half the crew of the Campbeltown. Only a few Commando teams on the launches made it ashore, none successfully at the Old Mole where they were hoping to re-embark and escape. The intact motor launches took on what survivors they could find or rescue from the water, made smoke and withdrew, leaving just over a hundred Commandos on the docks. MGB 314 survived and was the last vessel to leave, her decks covered in wounded men rescued from the water.\n* As the boats moved out into the wider part of the channel they came under fire from heavier guns, although at longer range. Two boats were destroyed in the race down river, one of the motor launches and MTB 74. Both vessels were carrying many wounded and most of the Campbeltown crew; their losses accounted for over half of the naval casualties. Four British vessels made the rendezvous with the destroyers.\n* The Commandos left behind at the docks were soon heavily pressed. Leaving a steady trail of dead and wounded the Commandos worked through the docks and charged the bridge, breaking through onto the Place de la Vieille Ville, but with barely one in four of the force uninjured. The British were forced southwards into the town and, under increasing fire sought cover.\n   * The Germans surrounded the town, posted road-blocks, stopped all traffic and conducted a house-to-house search. Almost all the British were captured or killed by around 10.00. They were assembled at La Baule, numbering roughly 200 and taken to various prisoner of war camps. Five British soldiers avoided capture and made it to Gibraltar.\n* The Campbeltown's charges were timed to go off at around 0900 hrs at the latest. Meanwhile, a German search of the ship failed to discover the hidden explosives. The detonation time came and went. During this delay, senior German officers arrived to inspect the damage and were photographed on deck. They were accompanied to the dock by two Commando officers who had been taken prisoner. The captured officers knew what was about to happen but remained silent, allowing themselves to be killed rather than give the Germans an opportunity to defuse the explosives.\n   * It was not until 1035 hrs that the Campbeltown finally exploded, destroying the caisson and killing about 250 German soldiers and civilians in the immediate area.\n* Of the 611 British soldiers, 169 had been killed and 200 captured, but the mission was a success and the dock was unusable until 1947."),

However, much was learned as a result of the operation, these lessons would be put to good use later in subsequent invasions.\n* For almost two years, there was no land-fighting on the Western Front with the exception of commando raids and the guerrilla actions of the resistance aided by the SOE and OSS.

As had so often happened on the Eastern Front Hitler refused to allow a strategic withdrawal until it was too late.\n   * 100,000 Germans managed to escape through the Falaise Gap but they left behind most of their equipment and 150,000 were taken prisoner.",

Barkmann positioned his Panther under a stand of oaks near the crossroads where the American tanks would have to pass.\n* As the column came into sight, Barkmann knocked out the two lead Shermans and a fuel tanker truck.\n    * Next he destroyed two Shermans which had attempted to bypass the burning tanker. The Americans called in fighter-bombers, which damaged Barkmann's Panther and wounded two of his crewmen.\n    * Barkmann's next victims were two Shermans that had used the noise of the fighter-bombers as cover to sneak up on the damaged Panther's flank.\n    As Barkmann's crew repaired the Panther, two more Shermans were knocked out.\n    * Finally, before leaving, Barkmann destroyed one last Sherman.\n* Barkmann knocked out nine Shermans and several other American vehicles and halted an American armored attack. For his actions, he was awarded the Knight's Cross.\n* On another occasion, Ernst Barkmann in Panther 401 accidentally found himself as the spearhead of the 2nd SS Panzer Division's night assault on the crossroads at Manhay. Initially mistaking a lone Sherman of US 7th Armoured Division as that of his own commander, he pulled alongside the enemy tank, and only realised his mistake when he noticed it's unusual red interior lights. In a brief close quarter fight he managed to destroy the M4 with the Panther's anti-personnel mortar (Panzergranate). He then proceeded along the moonlit forest roads past a succession of surprised American units to Manhay and on towards Liege, having left several destroyed vehicles in his wake. His appearance caused havoc in the US defences, culminating in a rout.\n* Rules: Ground Map, Turret Facing, Vehicle Criticals",

Although ULTRA, the Allies' reading of secret German radio messages, suggested a possible German offensive, and the United States Third Army predicted a major German offensive, the attack still achieved surprise.\n   * The degree of surprise achieved was compounded by the Allies' overconfidence, their preoccupation with their own offensive plans, poor aerial reconnaissance, and the relative lack of combat contact in the area by the U.S. 1st Army.
