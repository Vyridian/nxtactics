				Besides weapons and drugs, the Yakuza are the neighborhood protection in many areas and do so far more efficiently than the police. Contrary to the attitudes protrayed in Hollywood, the Yakuza make justice swift and fair for the people they deal with. It has done this way for longer than the United States has been around. The Yakuza is not about random violence and mayhem. It is about order and discipline. Of course, many of the younger members have cast aside traditions and have become violent thugs. Like the Triads, the Yakuza was originally a response to the feudal lords when those who were not samurai had no rights or safety.

			* Black Eagle is a large security firm offering 'specialists for hire'. They maintain a strong reputation for effectiveness, discipline, and discretion. Their fees are high, but they are the gold standard when dealing with critical situations on a moment's notice.
			* Black Eagle is based in Atlanta, Georgia. It maintains branch facilities in Miami, Dubai, the Phillipines, and South Africa.
			* Black Eagle provides contract security teams to guard embassies for major countries. They also can be engaged for
			deniable covert actions including: smash and grab, target removal, and cyber espianoge.
			* Black Eagle is very careful to maintain deniability in all of its activities. It does not have business cards or
			letter-head or logos. Its personnel are all independent contractors who are always paid by the job, in cash. There is 	always a risk that Black Eagle personnel will be captured, killed, or imprisoned. Black Eagle values loyalty above all
			else and will go to great lengths to prove itself when its own people get in trouble.
			* The true secret to Black Eagle's success is its information network. The company maintains a large database of 'persons of interest' along with psychological profiles and potential future value. Whenever possible, Black Eagle will trade favors instead of cash. They proactively offer help to key individuals who are in trouble, so they can count on those people for help in the future. Black Eagle has influence among numerous politicians, lobbyists, lawyers, judges, military personnel, police, prison guards, prisoners, criminal informants, as well as numerous ordinary people who serve as their eyes and ears on the street.
