		<scenario name="Battle of Verdun, 1916">
			<summary>
				* The Battle of Verdun was a ten month long ordeal between the French and German armies and is considered one of the most brutal events of WWI. Both the French and German armies suffered incredibly with an estimated 540,000 French and 430,000 German casualties and no strategic advantages were gained for either side.
				* In the years preceding World War I, Germany became Europe's leading industrial power. France felt increasingly threatened by German industrialization. As a response to the German threat of invasion, France built a continuous line of sunken forts from the Swiss frontier to the French city of Verdun making Verdun a vital strong point.
				* The German attack began on February 21, 1916 with an intense artillery bombardment of the forts surrounding Verdun. The French army retreated to predetermined positions while the German army pounded through the French lines.
				* Although three French forts near Verdun had capitulated to German forces, Verdun itself remained undefeated.
				* By April 1916, the French Air Force had secured the sky over Verdun, which would help the French to successfully defend the area. The British attack and a Russian offensive in the east forced the German army to transfer troops away from Verdun.
				* By December 1916, the French had advanced to their February 1916 lines, their original position. No new advantage had been gained for either side.

		<scenario name="Battles of the Marne, 1914, 1918">
			<summary>
				* On September 4, 1914, the rapid advances of the German army through Belgium and northern France caused panic in the French army and troops were rushed from Paris in taxis to halt the advance. Combined with the BEF (British Expeditionary Force) the Germans were eventually halted and the War settled into the familiar defensive series of entrenchment's.
				* Ironically, by the end of May, 1918, the Germans had again reached the Marne after the enormous successes of Ludendorff's offensives of that year. The intervening four years had cost hundreds of thousands of lives and the armies were still, literally, exactly where they had started.
			</summary>
		</scenario>
		<scenario name="Battles of Ypres, 1914, 1915, 1917">
			<summary>
				* There were in fact three battles fought around the Ypres salient during the War.
				* The first, in 1914 was an attempt by the BEF to halt the rapid advances made by the Germans.
				* The second, in 1915, was notable for the first use of poison gas by the Germans.
				* However, it is the long-planned offensive of July 31, 1917, that holds the most significance. Here, a combination of over-ambitious aims, appalling weather conditions, and misguided persistence by Haig led to horrific losses. By the time the offensive was called off total casualties for both sides had been approximately 250,000. The horrors of the battle, in which men drowned in liquid mud has become synonymous with the images of the War.
			</summary>
		</scenario>
		<scenario name="Battle of the Somme, 1916">
			<summary>
				* At 0730 hours on the 1st July, 1916, after a week long artillery bombardment launched the now infamous 'Big Push' attack across the river Somme. The British intended to breakthrough the German defenses in a matter of hours.
				* The mistrust that High Command had of the so-called 'New Armies' manifested itself in the orders to the troops to keep uniformed lines and to march towards the enemy across no-man's land. This, coupled with the failure of the artillery bombardment to dislodge much of the German wire, or to destroy their machine-gun posts, led to one of the biggest slaughters in military history.
				* After the first day, with a gain of only 1.5km, the British had suffered 57,470 casualties. Despite this, Haig pressed on with the attack until November 19th of the same year. For the meager achievements, total losses on the British and Imperial side numbered 419,654 with German casualties between 450,000 and 680,000. When the offensive was eventually called off the British were still 3 miles short of Bapaume and Serre, part of their first-day objectives.
			</summary>
		</scenario>
		<scenario name="Battle of Cambrai, 1917">
			<summary>
				On November 20, 1917, the British launched the first full-scale offensive that was designed exclusively to accommodate the British secret weapon, the tank (so-called because when the first shipment came from England they were described as water tanks to maintain secrecy). A surprise artillery barrage started the offensive and 476 tanks, packed tightly for a mass attack moved against the German lines. Supported by infantry the gains were dramatic, breaching the almost impregnable Hindenberg line to depths of 4-5 miles in some places. However, these gains seemed to surprise British High Command equally as much as the Germans, and the following cavalry failed to take advantage. Nevertheless, Cambrai demonstrated how a well-thought out attack, combining tanks en masse with surprise, could be used to break the trench deadlock.

		<summary>
			* Ground Combat - WWI began the use of mechanized warfare, but WWII redefined it in every way. The
			Germans invented the Blitzkrieg to leverage the power of mechanized units to shatter their opponents traditional defenses. Tank warfare was defined in WWII, however, because units must still stop to target, they cannot generally move at top speeds. Map scale is therefore based on moderately slow ground unit movement.
			* Naval Combat - WWII was the turning point of Naval Warfare when air power made traditional naval combat obsolete. Even submarines and torpedoes were insignificant compared to the effect of air power. Map scale is therefore based primarily on aircraft speed.
		</summary>
	</section>
	<section name="Turning Points of the War">
		<summary>
			* While the unconditional surrender of German armed forces represented a resounding Allied success, in retrospect, it is clear that particular factors and choices strongly affected the pace and course of the campaign.
			* D-Day - The Allied deception as to where the D-Day landings would take place was very successful, with the majority of the German command convinced the landings would take place at Calais. The Germans underestimated Allied willingness to risk an amphibious assault over a route longer than the shortest path across the English Channel.
			* Hedgerows - While the Allies meticulously planned the D-Day landings, they failed to assess the countryside immediately beyond the beaches, which resulted in the Germans very successfully using the hedgerow country as a system of natural defensive works that took the Allies two months to clear at a staggering cost in infantry casualties. Historians have also asserted the U.S. Army should have landed on the eastern end of the Normandy beaches and formed the northern wing of Allied forces in Northwest Europe because the mobility of American forces could have been better used in the more open terrain and most direct route to Berlin that the northern approach offered. As it was, the pre-invasion basing of troops in England determined the arrangement of the landing forces.
			* Underestimation - While the Germans had reason to occasionally doubt Allied military proficiency, it is clear the Germans too often underestimated Allied competency. This habit of underestimation led to the rejection of any notion that the Allies might have broken German military ciphers, most famously the Enigma code. The ability to monitor German military communications was an Allied strategic asset of the highest order. Less dramatically, the Germans often underestimated Allied troop proficiency, a habit that resulted in occasional sharp defeats for overconfident German units.
			* Manpower - The German ability to form a cohesive defensive line after the disaster their forces endured in Normandy was due almost entirely to the ability of the German Ersatzheer (Replacement Army) to quickly deploy large numbers of new troops. These inexperienced troops were paired with seasoned cadres who swiftly transformed the replacements into combat units. Thus, while the Allies took large numbers of German prisoners during their advance from Normandy to the German border, they  underestimated the ability of the Germans to reconstitute their forces under very disadvantageous circumstances. The Allies also seriously underestimated the infantry casualties their forces would suffer in Northwestern Europe. Shortages of American manpower were strongly aggravated by a tendency to attack head-on regardless of circumstances, a habit that was particularly in evidence during the months of fighting in the Huertgen Forest. The Allied logistical crisis that dominated their operations from September through December had the further pernicious effect of limiting the number of divisions in England that could be moved onto the continent to reinforce the front, since the Allies were only able to supply a limited number of divisions east of the Seine River. After the Allies mastered the logistical crisis, the Americans diverted divisions bound for the Pacific Theater to Europe in a belated realization that more divisions were needed for operations in Europe.
			* German Strategic Errors - While the Germans achieved strategic surprise with their offensive in the Ardennes, the Panzer divisions that had been so painstakingly rebuilt could have been more profitably used to defend the Siegfried Line and the Rhineland, or perhaps, in the defense of Berlin against the Red Army. The German thrust failed to shatter their enemies' alliance and cost Germany high casualties and equipment losses it could ill-afford. This folly was repeated in Alsace in January, but with the added disadvantage this time that the Allies were expecting the attack.
			* American Strategic Errors - Upon breaking out of Normandy in August, the Americans committed two armored divisions to operations in Brittany when armored units were direly needed for the pursuit of the German army across France. While the port of Brest, France was ultimately captured by the Americans, it consumed operations for an entire month and ultimately did little for the Allied effort because the Germans so thoroughly destroyed the port before it was captured. Out of fear that two wings of their forces might collide, the Allies failed to definitively close the Falaise Gap in August, allowing trapped German forces an escape route to the east. Experienced German leadership cadres evaded Allied forces and were available to reconstitute a cohesive front line along the Siegfried Line.
			* Antwerp - Although British forces conducted a brilliant pursuit across northern France that resulted in the liberation of the critically important port of Antwerp in early September, they failed to promptly clear the Scheldt Estuary of Germans. The Germans immediately grasped the significance of the Scheldt Estuary and moved in troops to conduct a lengthy defense. The port of Antwerp could not be used until November 28, and strongly contributed to the lengthy logistical crisis that hamstrung Allied operations for four months.
			* Operation Market-Garden was a double failure in the sense that the resources used for it would have been more profitably committed to clearing the Scheldt Estuary instead of carving out an extended salient that did nothing but extend an already over-extended Allied front line.
			* Siegfreid Line - Despite grave shortages of riflemen, American operations in front of the Siegfried Line, particularly in U.S. First Army's area, were characterized by bloody frontal assaults. Stubbornness and misplaced notions that the U.S. Army could not allow itself to abandon unprofitable operations saw five infantry divisions shredded in the Huertgen Forest fighting, with the attack being abandoned only in December after the Germans attacked into the Ardennes. The concentration of divisions in the Huertgen Forest also forced a corresponding lack of concentration along the Ardennes front, with the result that only four U.S. divisions were initially available to parry a 26 division German offensive.
			* Eisenhower - When, in November, the Allies enjoyed significant success in 6th Army Group's area, General Eisenhower refused to reinforce the success and even forbade his commanders in the south to attempt to assault across the Rhine in the area of Strasbourg while the German defenses were in shambles. This lack of bold enterprise was a by-product of General Eisenhower's decision to conduct limited-objective attacks on a broad front even though the Allies lacked a sufficient number of divisions to both man a broad front and concentrate enough combat power in chosen areas to achieve breakthroughs. When American troops reached the Elbe River in mid-April, General Eisenhower unilaterally decided that Berlin was no longer a significant military objective. He knew that Berlin would be deep within the Soviet zone of post-war Germany and saw no reason to fight for land that would have to be given to the Soviets after the war. Eisenhower pointed out to Patton that it was of no military strategic value and would take up a lot of resources to occupy and asked Patton 'Who would want it?' Patton replied 'I think history will answer that question for you.' Unswayed by Patton, Simpson or even Churchill, Eisenhower ordered U.S. forces to halt along the Elbe and Mulde rivers. Thus, these spearheads were practically immobilized while the war raged on for three more weeks.
			* Bradley - Simultaneously, General Bradley considered the Germans trapped in the Ruhr Pocket to be the most significant threat and committed surprisingly large numbers of U.S. troops to collapse (as opposed to containing) the pocket instead of reinforcing his troops at the Elbe River. As a consequence of Eisenhower's decision, the British 21st Army Group was ordered to drive northeast in the direction of Hamburg instead of proceeding due east in the direction of Berlin.
			* Propaganda - The Allies proved curiously gullible about German propaganda claiming the existence of a 'National Redoubt' in the Alpine hinterlands of Bavaria and Austria. Fearing a large-scale last stand by the Nazis in this so-called redoubt, General Eisenhower directed no less than three field armies to clear southern Germany at a time when the largest groups of German forces stood to the east, not the south, of General Eisenhower's troops. Fortunately for the Allies, the German Army of April 1945 was in no position to exploit troop concentrations and movements of questionable merit.
			* Thus, while the Allies enjoyed a great victory, on occasion their prosecution of the campaign afforded their German adversaries opportunities that prolonged the fighting unnecessarily.

			Although the Netherlands had been neutral during World War I, Dutch sympathies during that conflict were more on the German side. At the end of World War I, the Netherlands gave asylum to German Emperor Wilhelm II and refused to release him into Allied custody, instead giving him a castle, Huis Doorn, where he lived until his death in 1941. Following outbreak of the Second World War, the Netherlands hoped to remain neutral just like they had done 25 years previously.

After taking the city, the plan was to force the Dutch queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands to surrender and to thus defeat the Dutch within a single day. It was the first major air-landing operation in history, and due to the failure, had negative effects on the German Military for the rest of the war.
				* The failure of the operation reduced confidence in airborne assaults, reduced airborne troops substantially, and reduced transport aircraft which later caused more casualties in the Invasion of Crete where since the Germans did not have sufficient craft to land troopers in force, they instead had to drop them in groups, resulting in heavy casualties. Hitler intentionally had this battle downplayed to maintain the illusion that the German Army was invincible. It was one of few German defeats throughout the entire Western Front Campaign in 1940.

			<summary>
				* The British public were shocked that their most emblematic warship had been destroyed so suddenly. The Admiralty mobilized every available warship in the Atlantic to hunt down and destroy Bismarck.
    * On May 26, the British had a stroke of luck. Bismarck was spotted due to an oil leak. The Bismarck was about to escape under German Air cover, so all British hopes were now pinned on the  aircraft-carrier Ark Royal, the old battlecruiser Renown and the cruiser Sheffield.
				* At dusk that evening, and in atrocious weather conditions, Ark Royal launched its Fairey Swordfish. The first wave mistakenly targeted the Sheffield that was by now shadowing the quarry. Although precious time was lost by this incident, it proved beneficial to the British in that the magnetic detonators on the torpedoes used against Sheffield were seen to be defective and for the following attack on Bismarck were replaced by those designed to explode on contact.
				* In a final attack, almost in darkness at 21:05, a hit by a single torpedo jammed Bismarck's rudder and steering gear. This rendered Bismarck virtually unmanoeuvrable, increased her list to port and she was able only to steam in a large circle.
    * Throughout that night, Bismarck was the target of incessant torpedo attacks by Tribal-class
				destroyers. Both Ark Royal and King George V had a lucky escape during the night. The British ships were unaware they had come within firing range of U-556. However, U-556 was returning from a combat patrol and had spent its torpedoes. This was particularly galling as U-556 and Bismarck had exercised together in the Baltic, Bismarck was dubbed the submarine's 'bigger brother'.
				* The Rodney and King George V began bombardment of the crippled Bismarck. It continued to fire back, but in its crippled state it was an easy target. Within 44 minutes, Bismarck's heavy guns were all silent. Rodney now closed to point-blank range (approximately three km) to pound the superstructure, while King George V fired from further out.
    * With no sign of surrender, despite the unequal struggle, the British were loath to leave Bismarck.
				Their fuel and shell supplies were low, a demonstration of how difficult it was for a battleship to sink a similar unit, even in an unbalanced engagement. 3 more torpedoes were launched at close range and on the Bismarck the order was given to scuttle the ship.
    * Dorsetshire and Maori stopped to rescue survivors, but a U-boat alarm caused them to leave the scene after rescuing only 110 Bismarck sailors, abandoning the surviving crew in the water.
    * The next morning U-74, which had heard sinking noises from a distance, and the German weather ship Sachsenwald picked up 5 survivors. 1,995 of the 2,200 crew were lost.

	<section name="St. Nazaire Raid">
		<summary>
			* The St. Nazaire Raid (also called Operation Chariot) was a successful British seaborne attack on the heavily defended docks of St. Nazaire in occupied France on the night of March 28, 1942 during World War II.
			* The plan was to create a diversionary bombing run and then use the obsolete destroyer HMS Campbeltown to ram the St. Nazaire lock gates and then to blow it up. Commandos would then destroy other dock structures and fight their way out. The loss of the St. Nazaire as a dry dock would force any large German warship in need of repairs to return to home waters.
			* The Cambeltown was given cosmetic modifications so that she would resemble a German Mowe class destroyer. The diversionary bombing did little except to alert the German forces that something odd was happening. Despite this the British ships got very close to the harbour without being fired on. Rather than use the deep channel which passed near the German guns, Cambeltown used the spring tide to pass over shallows, being lightened by removing guns, etc, though this also affected her handling characteristics.
   * The force was first noticed at 01:15 but searchlights did not go on until 01:22 when the force was little more than 1.5 nautical miles (2.8 km) from the harbor. The British legitimately flew the Kriegsmarine ensign as a false flag and used a German morse call sign and gained almost five minutes of unimpeded progress. Twice the German guns opened fire but were soon silenced by reassuring coded messages.
   * It was not until 01:28 with less than a mile to the harbor that the German guns opened fire. The Campbeltown drew most fire but despite a number of casualties struck the southern caisson at around 20 knots (37 km/h) at 01:34, jamming herself deep into the structure and crumpling almost 40 feet (12 m) of her hull. The delay fuses had been set shortly before the ship came under fire.
   * The seven Commando teams then disembarked and made for their targets.
			* The seventeen smaller vessels, although receiving less fire, were much more vulnerable. In the four minutes around the ramming by the Campbeltown eight of the launches were destroyed in the channel. A few hits were often sufficient to set the motor launches ablaze and the crew and Commandos had to abandon themselves to the water or Carley rafts. Many drowned or were caught in the burning fuel that spread across the water. Most of the eight craft destroyed suffered greater than 80% fatalities, even on the surviving craft barely a man escaped injury.
			* MTB 74 survived, fired her special torpedoes into the lock at the old entrance and made it back out to sea after taking on around half the crew of the Campbeltown. Only a few Commando teams on the launches made it ashore, none successfully at the Old Mole where they were hoping to re-embark and escape. The intact motor launches took on what survivors they could find or rescue from the water, made smoke and withdrew, leaving just over a hundred Commandos on the docks. MGB 314 survived and was the last vessel to leave, her decks covered in wounded men rescued from the water.
			* As the boats moved out into the wider part of the channel they came under fire from heavier guns, although at longer range. Two boats were destroyed in the race down river, one of the motor launches and MTB 74. Both vessels were carrying many wounded and most of the Campbeltown crew; their losses accounted for over half of the naval casualties. Four British vessels made the rendezvous with the destroyers.
			* The Commandos left behind at the docks were soon heavily pressed. Leaving a steady trail of dead and wounded the Commandos worked through the docks and charged the bridge, breaking through onto the Place de la Vieille Ville, but with barely one in four of the force uninjured. The British were forced southwards into the town and, under increasing fire sought cover.
   * The Germans surrounded the town, posted road-blocks, stopped all traffic and conducted a house-to-house search. Almost all the British were captured or killed by around 10.00. They were assembled at La Baule, numbering roughly 200 and taken to various prisoner of war camps. Five British soldiers avoided capture and made it to Gibraltar.
			* The Campbeltown's charges were timed to go off at around 0900 hrs at the latest. Meanwhile, a German search of the ship failed to discover the hidden explosives. The detonation time came and went. During this delay, senior German officers arrived to inspect the damage and were photographed on deck. They were accompanied to the dock by two Commando officers who had been taken prisoner. The captured officers knew what was about to happen but remained silent, allowing themselves to be killed rather than give the Germans an opportunity to defuse the explosives.
   * It was not until 1035 hrs that the Campbeltown finally exploded, destroying the caisson and killing about 250 German soldiers and civilians in the immediate area.
			* Of the 611 British soldiers, 169 had been killed and 200 captured, but the mission was a success and the dock was unusable until 1947.

The raid was a disaster, and almost two-thirds of the attacking force became casualties. However, much was learned as a result of the operation, these lessons would be put to good use later in subsequent invasions.
			* For almost two years, there was no land-fighting on the Western Front with the exception of commando raids and the guerrilla actions of the resistance aided by the SOE and OSS.

   * Following two months of slow fighting in hedgerow country, the Allies were racing across France. They circled around and trapped 250,000 Germans in the Falaise pocket. As had so often happened on the Eastern Front Hitler refused to allow a strategic withdrawal until it was too late.

Barkmann positioned his Panther under a stand of oaks near the crossroads where the American tanks would have to pass.
				* As the column came into sight, Barkmann knocked out the two lead Shermans and a fuel tanker truck.
    * Next he destroyed two Shermans which had attempted to bypass the burning tanker. The Americans called in fighter-bombers, which damaged Barkmann's Panther and wounded two of his crewmen.
    * Barkmann's next victims were two Shermans that had used the noise of the fighter-bombers as cover to sneak up on the damaged Panther's flank.
    As Barkmann's crew repaired the Panther, two more Shermans were knocked out.
    * Finally, before leaving, Barkmann destroyed one last Sherman.
				* Barkmann knocked out nine Shermans and several other American vehicles and halted an American armored attack. For his actions, he was awarded the Knight's Cross.
				* On another occasion, Ernst Barkmann in Panther 401 accidentally found himself as the spearhead of the 2nd SS Panzer Division's night assault on the crossroads at Manhay. Initially mistaking a lone Sherman of US 7th Armoured Division as that of his own commander, he pulled alongside the enemy tank, and only realised his mistake when he noticed it's unusual red interior lights. In a brief close quarter fight he managed to destroy the M4 with the Panther's anti-personnel mortar (Panzergranate). He then proceeded along the moonlit forest roads past a succession of surprised American units to Manhay and on towards Liege, having left several destroyed vehicles in his wake. His appearance caused havoc in the US defences, culminating in a rout.

		<summary>
			* The 'bulge' was the initial incursion the Germans put into the Allies' line of advance. The offensive was launched in the Ardennes. Germany's planned goal for these operations was to split the British and American Allied line in half, capturing Antwerp, Belgium, and then proceeding to encircle and destroy four Allied armies, forcing the Western Allies to negotiate a peace treaty in the Axis Powers' favor.
			* The Germans planned the offensive with utmost secrecy, minimizing radio traffic and conducting the movement of troops and equipment under cover of darkness. Although ULTRA, the Allies' reading of secret German radio messages, suggested a possible German offensive, and the United States Third Army predicted a major German offensive, the attack still achieved surprise.
   * The degree of surprise achieved was compounded by the Allies' overconfidence, their preoccupation with their own offensive plans, poor aerial reconnaissance, and the relative lack of combat contact in the area by the U.S. 1st Army. Almost complete surprise against a weak section of the Allies' line was achieved during heavy overcast weather, when the Allies' strong air forces would be grounded.
			* For the U.S. Army, the battle incorporated more troops and engaged more enemy troops than any conflict before that time. The German objectives ultimately were unrealized. In the wake of the defeat, many experienced German units were left severely depleted of men and equipment.

		<summary>
			* The codename for Nazi Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union during WWII that commenced on June 22, 1941. Over 4.5 million troops of the Axis powers invaded the USSR along an 1,800 mile front. The operation was named after the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa of the Holy Roman Empire, a leader of the Third Crusade in the 12th century. Barbarossa was the major part of the war on the Eastern Front. The planning for operation Barbarossa took several years prior to June 1941; the clandestine preparations and the military operation itself lasted almost a year, from the Spring of 1941, through the Winter of 1941.
			* The operational goal of Operation Barbarossa was the rapid conquest of the European part of the Soviet Union, west of a line connecting the cities of Arkhangelsk and Astrakhan, often referred to as the A-A line (see the translation of Hitler's directive for details). At its conclusion in December 1941, the Red Army had repelled the strongest blow of the Wehrmacht. Hitler had not achieved the victory he had expected, but the situation of the Soviet Union remained critical. Tactically the Germans had won some resounding victories and occupied some of the most important economic areas of the country, most notably in Ukraine. Despite these successes, the Germans were pushed back from Moscow and were not able to mount an offensive simultaneously along the entire strategic Soviet-German front again.
			* Then the failure of Barbarossa resulted in Hitler's demands for additional operations inside Russia, all of which eventually failed, such as continuation of the Siege of Leningrad, Operation Nordlicht, and Battle of Stalingrad, among other battles on the occupied Russian territory.
			* The failure of Operation Barbarossa resulted in the eventual defeat of Nazi Germany and is considered a turning point for the Third Reich. Most importantly, Operation Barbarossa opened up the Eastern Front, which ultimately became the biggest theater of war in world history. Operation Barbarossa and the areas which fell under it became the site of some of the largest and most brutal battles, deadliest atrocities, terrible loss of life, and horrific conditions for Soviets and Germans alike - all of which influenced the course of both WWII and 20th Century history.

			* Kursk is further notable for the deliberately defensive operation strategy on the Red Army's part. Having good intelligence on Hitler's intentions, the Red Army established and managed to conceal elaborate layered defense works, mine fields, and stage and disguise large reserve forces poised for a tactical and strategic counter-attack typical of defensive battle plans. Though the Germans planned and initiated an offensive strike, the well-planned defense not only frustrated their ambitions, but also enabled the Soviets to follow up with counter-offensives that exhausted the German abilities in the Theater, thereby seizing the initiative for the remainder of the war.

The Italians had 150,000 troops and tanks were evenly divided between the mechanically reliable but machine gun-armed Fiat L3s tankettes and the heavier Fiat M11/39. This tank featured a hull-mounted 37 mm tank gun which was difficult to bring to bear on targets because of its lack of available traverse, was relatively poorly armored and was mechanically unreliable. In comparison, the British were able to field some faster Cruiser tanks (the Mk I, Mk II, and Mk III) which were more than match to the M11/39s. The British also had a limited number of heavy Matilda Infantry tanks that, while slow, were strongly armored and well armed. The armour of the Matilda tanks could not be pierced by any of the available Italian tank guns or anti-tank guns available at that time though Italian anti-aircraft guns could be used against them in the same manner as the German 88mm.
			* On December 18, 1940, British and Indian infantry and 48 Matilda tanks suddenly appeared outside the Italian Nibeiwa Camp. They struck twenty-three unmanned M11/39 tanks of the Maletti Group, which had been deployed to guard the unmined entrance to the camp. The Italians were caught completely off guard and many did not even reach their tanks, including General Maletti, who was killed emerging from his dugout. They were slaughtered and their vehicles destroyed by the British in less than ten minutes.
   * The Italian artillery fought on valiantly, firing on the Matildas and recording many hits, some at point-blank range - but none penetrated their 70mm of armour. The remaining Italian tanks were captured intact, and the Libyan infantry, left practically defenceless, quickly surrendered.
   * The British had captured Nibeiwa and destroyed the only front-line Italian armoured unit in

			* The stunning defeat of the Italians did not go unnoticed and fresh Italian troops together with German troops, the Deutsches Afrikakorps under Erwin Rommel were sent in to reinforce the Italian forces in western Libya. Although Rommel had been ordered to simply hold the line, an armoured reconnaissance soon became a fully fledged offensive.

Oran and Morocco were then convinced to cease resistance with the proviso that the Vichy Admiral Darlan would be head of the Free French administration. The Vichy army joined the Allies and formed the Free French Forces.
   * On December 24, Darlan was assassinated for his collaboration with the Nazis.

	<section name="Western Desert Campaign">
		<summary>
			* The Western Desert Campaign, also known as the Desert War was the initial stage of the North African Campaign. The Axis powers had planned to dominate the Mediterranean through control of Gibraltar and the Suez Canal and planned to follow a successful campaign in North Africa with a strike north to the rich oil fields of the Middle East. This would have cut off nearby oil supplies to the Allies, and would have tremendously increased the oil supplies available for the Axis war machine.
			* By 1942, the campaign was heavily influenced by the availability of supplies and transport. Large quantities of supplies were becoming available form the United States. The British and Italian navies were evenly matched in the Mediterranean, but the British retention of Malta allowed the RAF to interdict an increasing amount of Italian supplies at sea denying the German commander, Rommel, fuel and reinforcements at critical moments.

			* On November 24, two Allied columns prepared to advance from Djebel Abiod.
   * The Blade Force made a lightning attack with tanks and destroyed more than 20 Axis planes, buildings, and supply dumps.
			* The northern force was delayed by torrential rain, but the Germans had used the extra time to create an ambush position on the road at Jefna. The Germans occupied high ground on either side of the road, which after the recent heavy rains was very muddy and the ground on either side impassable for vehicles.
   * The ambush worked perfectly with the leading battalion taking 149 casualties. Units were sent into the hills to try to flush the Germans out but the stubborn resistance of the paratroopers combined with the cleverly planned interlocking defenses proved too much.
			* The position remained in German hands until the last days of fighting in Tunisia the following spring.

			* On December 22, 1942, the British Coldstream Guards drove back the German 10th Panzer Division from Longstop Hill. They were then relieved and withdrawn to Mejdez. The Germans regained the hill in a counter-attack and the Coldstreams were ordered back to Longstop. They regained the peak, but with ammunition running low and Axis forces holding adjacent high ground they were forced to withdraw.

		<summary>
			* The Battle of Kasserine Pass was, in fact, a series of battles fought around Kasserine Pass, a two-mile (3 km) wide gap in the Grand Dorsal chain of the Atlas Mountains in west central Tunisia.
			* The Axis forces involved were from the German-Italian Panzer Army led by Field Marshal Erwin Rommel and the Fifth Panzer Army led by General Hans-Jurgen von Arnim.
			* The Allied forces involved came from the U.S. Army's II Corps commanded by Major-General Lloyd Fredendall which was part of the British First Army commanded by Lieutenant-General Kenneth Anderson.
			* Significant as the first large-scale meeting of American and German forces in World War II, the untested American troops, who were led in an inept manner by their commander, suffered heavy casualties and were pushed back over fifty miles (80km) from their original positions west of Faid Pass in a humiliating rout.
   * The battle has been described as when the amateurs first met the professionals. In the aftermath, the U.S. Army instituted sweeping changes from unit-level organization to the replacing of commanders.
   * When they next met, in some cases only weeks later, the U.S. was considerably stronger.

			* On January 23, 1943, the Allies took Tripoli, thereby cutting off Rommel's main supply base. Rommel had planned for this eventuality. With their lines steadied by the Atlas Mountains on the west and Gulf of Sidra on the east, even small numbers of German/Italian troops would be able to hold off the Allied forces.
			* Upsetting this plan was the fact that Allied troops had already crossed the Atlas Mountains. This put them in an excellent position to thrust east to the coast and cut off Rommel's forces and cut his line of supply to Tunis. Obviously, the Axis could not allow this to occur.
   * The Panzer Divisions moved on the Atlas Mountans. Several attempts were made by the U.S. 1st Armored Division to stop their advance, but all three combat commands found themselves faced with the classic blitzkrieg every time they were ordered into a defensive position, they would find those positions had already been overrun, and they were attacked by German soldiers with heavy losses.

   * The battle raged for a day, but poor use of armor by the U.S. led to their defeat. By this point, the U.S. forces had lost 2,546 men, 103 tanks, 280 vehicles, 18 field guns, 3 antitank guns, and an entire antiaircraft battery.

			* On February 19, 1943, Rommel launched an assault that broke the U.S. lines within minutes. Their light guns and tanks had no chance against the heavier German equipment, and they had little or no experience in armored warfare. The German Panzer IVs and Tiger tanks fended off all attacks with ease; the M3 Lee and M3 Stuart tanks they faced were inferior in firepower and their crews far less experienced.
   * Under fierce tank attack, the American units on Highway 13 also gave way during the night, with men at all points retreating before the Italian 131st Centauro Armoured Division.
			* Once again, the 1st Armored Division found itself ordered into useless positions. Morale among the U.S. troops started to fall precipitously, and by evening many troops had pulled back, leaving their equipment on the field.
   * The pass was completely open, and it appeared the supply dump at Tebessa was within reach. However, desperate resistance by isolated groups left behind in the action seriously slowed the German advance.

If they took it the U.S. 9th Infantry Division would be cut off from their supplies, and Combat Command B of the 1st Armored Division would be trapped by the 10th Panzer division. That night, small units of British, French, and U.S. forces freed from the line to the north were sent piecemeal into the lines at Thala. 
   * 48 artillery guns were emplaced that night. When the battle reopened the next day, the defenses were much stronger; the front line was held largely by British infantry with exceptionally strong backing by U.S. Artillery.
   * Overextended and undersupplied, Rommel decided to end the offensive.
			* After the battle, Rommel was largely contemptuous of both the U.S. equipment and fighting ability and considered them a non-threat. U.S. Commander Lloyd Fredendall was relieved and sent to a noncombat assignment for the remainder of the war. Fredendall's subordinates had no confidence in him as their commander and British First Army commander also thought Fredendall incompetent.
			* On March 6, Major-General George S. Patton was placed in command with the explicit task of improving performance.

			an attack southward in the direction of Medenine, the northernmost British strongpoint.
   * British artillery fire was intense, beating off the Axis attack and knocking out 55 Axis tanks.
			* With the failure of Capri, Rommel decided that the only way to save his armies would be to evacuate them. He therefore left Tunisia to see Hitler to try to convince him to abandon Tunisia and return the Axis armies to Europe. Hitler refused, and Rommel was placed, in strict secrecy, on sick leave.

			* On April 23, 1943, in grim hand-to hand fighting against Infantry and Panzer Divisions, the U.S. took eight days to penetrate 6 miles (9.7km) and capture most of the Axis defensive positions. Casualties were heavy on both sides.
			* On May 13, 1943, the Axis forces surrendered yielding over 275,000 prisoners of war including most of the Afrika Korps. This huge loss of experienced troops greatly reduced the military capacity of the Axis powers, although the largest percentage of Axis troops escaped Tunisia.

			* According to historian Williamson A. Murray 'The decision to reinforce North Africa was one of the worst of Hitler's blunder: admittedly, it kept the Mediterranean closed for six more months, with a negative impact on the Allied shipping situation, but it placed some of Germany's best troops in an indefensible position from which, like Stalingrad, there would be no escape. Moreover Hitler committed the Luftwaffe to fight a battle of attrition under unfavorable conditions, and it suffered losses that it could not afford.'
			* The Axis's desperate gamble had only slowed the inevitable, and the US loss at Kasserine may, paradoxically, have been the best thing that could have happened to them.
   * With North Africa now in Allied hands, plans quickly turned to the invasion of Sicily, and Italy after it.

<chapter name="WWII East African Theatre">
	<summary>
		* The battles of this campaign were fought between the forces of the British Empire, the British Commonwealth of Nations, and the forces of the Italian Empire.
		* The Commonwealth forces included troops from the Sudan, British Somaliland, British East Africa, the Indian Empire, South Africa, Northern Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia, Nyasaland, and British West Africa (Nigeria, Gold Coast, Sierra Leone, and the Gambia). There was even a small commando unit from the British Mandate of Palestine. In addition to the British and Commonwealth forces, there were Ethiopian irregular forces, Free French forces, and Free Belgian forces.
		* In November 1940, the British and Commonwealth forces received an incredible intelligence advantage. The government code and cypher school broke the high grade cypher of the Italian Royal Army in East Africa. Later, during the same month, the replacement cypher for the Italian Royal Air Force was broken.
  * From this point on, the commanders knew Italian plans as soon as they were issued.
	</summary>
	<section name="Italian Forces">
		<summary>
			* Troops - The Italian forces included Italian nationals, East African colonials (Eritreans, Abyssinians, and Somali Dubats), and a small number of German volunteers (the German Motorized Company).
			* The Italians had between 250,000 and 280,000 troops available. Most of them (about 70%) were local East African askaris. While the askaris of the regular Eritrean battalions of the 'Royal Corps of Colonial Troops' (Regio Corpo Truppe Coloniali) were amongst the best Italian units in East Africa, the majority of the colonial troops were recruited, trained, and equipped to do no more than maintain order in the colony. Ethiopian askaris and irregulars, recruited during the brief Italian occupation, deserted in large numbers after the outbreak of war.
   * The Royal Corps of Colonial Troops included horse mounted Eritrean cavalry known as 'Falcon Feathers' (Penne di Falcon). On one occasion a squadron of these horsemen charged British and Commonwealth troops throwing small hand grenades from the saddle.
			* The Italian forces were equipped with about 3,300 machine guns, 24 M11/39 tanks, a large number of L3/35 tankettes, 126 armored cars and 813 pieces of assorted artillery. The Italian faced problems with isolation of the East Africa, with very little chance for reinforcements or resupply, leading to problems especially with ammunition.
			* Malaria - It is estimated that nearly one-quarter of the Italians troops defending Amba Alagi in April 1941 had malaria during the siege. Unfortunately, the Italians at Amba Alagi had no medicine for malaria. Even the commander of Amba Alagi, the Duke of Aosta, was himself afflicted with malaria during the siege. He died of tuberculosis and malaria on 3 March 1942, a few months after his surrender.
			* Aircraft - The Italians had 200-300 Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 and Savoia-Marchetti SM.81 bombers and Fiat CR-42 fighters. While some of these aircraft were outdated, in relative terms these were some of the best aircraft available to either side in East Africa in 1940. In addition, the Italian aircraft were often based at better airfields than their British and Commonwealth counter-parts. When the war began, Italian pilots were relatively well trained and confident of their abilities. But, cut off from Italy as they were, problems with lack of fuel, munitions, spare parts, and replacements eventually wore the Italian air capability down.
			* Navy - Italian Naval power maintained presence in the Red Sea region with its 'Red Sea Flotilla' consisting of seven destroyers, five motor torpedo boats and eight submarines.

	<section name="Allied Forces">
		<summary>
			* Troops - The British and Commonwealth forces in East Africa amounted to about 30,000 men in the Sudan, British East Africa, and British Somaliland. The British were slightly better equipped than the Italians, and had access to resupply and reinforcements. However, they were vastly outnumbered by the Italian forces. To make matters worse, the Italians had at least another 208,000 men (fourteen divisions) available in Libya.
			* Gideon Force - A significant aspect of the Allied campaign to retake Ethiopia was an elite group of Ethiopian irregulars called Gideon Force that would tie down large number of Italian units throughout the colony.
			* Aircraft - The roughly one-hundred aircraft available to the British and Commonwealth forces at the beginning of the campaign were dispersed as follows: In the north (Sudan) were two Royal Air Force (RAF) bomber squadrons at Port Sudan (one of these squadron was equipped with obsolete aircraft) and the RAF Army Co-operation Squadron on the Sudan frontier. In the south (Kenya) were No. 12 Bomber Squadron of the South African Air Force (SAAF) (equipped with Junkers Ju 86 bombers), No. 11 Bomber Squadron of the SAAF (equipped with Fairey Battles), No. 40 Army Co-operation Squadron SAAF (equipped with Hawker Hartebees), No. 2 Fighter Squadron, SAAF (equipped with Hawker Furies), and No.
			237 (Southern Rhodesian) Army Co-operation Squadron (equipped with Hawker Hardys). Unlike the Italians, the aircraft available to the British and Commonwealth forces got better with time. But much of the equipment initially available tended to be older and slower. Even so, the British and Commonwealth forces managed to make do with what they had.
			* Navy - Allied Naval presence is very high in the Indian Ocean, but the Eastern Fleet largely consisted of older capital ships that had been deemed too slow or too vulnerable to be of use in the Atlantic Ocean or the Mediterranean Sea.

			* By August 19, the Italians took control of British Somaliland which was the first British colony to fall to enemy forces in World War II. The Italians, however, had taken nearly 10 times the number of casualties as the British.
			* Winston Churchill, criticized General Archibald Wavell concerning the loss of British Somaliland. Because of the low casualty rate, Churchill fretted that the British had abandoned the colony without enough of a fight. In response to this criticism, Wavell claimed that Somaliland was a textbook withdrawal in the face of superior numbers. He pointed out to Churchill that 'A bloody butcher's bill is not the sign of a good tactician.' According to Churchill's staff, Wavell's retort moved Churchill to greater fury than they had ever seen before.
			* In September, 1940, Indian Infantry Divisions started arriving in the Sudan.
			* Throughout November, December, and early January, the British continued to apply constant pressure on the Italians all along the border with the Sudan. Better British aircraft started to replace some of the
			older models. The new Hawker Hurricanes were clearly superior to the Italian Fiat CR-42. Additionally, a series of failed naval engagements had lost a number of Italian warships with few British losses.

			* Keren was as hard a soldiers' battle as was ever fought, and let it be said that nowhere in the war did the Germans fight more stubbornly than those [Italian] Savoia battalions. The unfortunate license of wartime propaganda allowed the British Press to represent the Italians almost as comic warriors; but except for the German parachute division in Italy and the Japanese in Burma no enemy with whom the British and Indian troops were matched put up a finer fight. Moreover, the Colonial troops, until they cracked at the very end, fought with valor and resolution, and their staunchness was a testimony to the excellence of the Italian administration and Military.

They drove galleries into the solid rock to protect their troops and to hold ample ammunition and stores. In this mountain fortress, the defenders, under command of Amedeo, Duke of Aosta, thought themselves to be impregnable.
			* The 7000 Italian troops were faced by 9000 British troops and 20000 Ethiopian irregulars. A final assault was planned for 15 May, but a fortuitous artillery shell hit an Italian fuel dump and ruptured a vessel containing oil which flowed into the remaining drinking water of the Italian defenders. The lack of drinkable water then forced the Italians to surrender.
			* On 18 May, Amedeo, Duke of Aosta surrendered his embattled forces at Amba Alagi and received full military honors. While the Duke of Aosta faced defeat in East Africa, his brother, the Duke of Spoleto was being made the King of Croatia after the successful invasion of Yugoslavia. The Duke of Aosta had endured the last months of fighting while suffering a severe attack of malaria (and died of TBC and malaria a few months later).

	<summary>
		* Although Southwest Asia was destined to remain a strategic backwater for the duration of World War II, in late 1941 and early 1942 the Allies were not certain that it would remain so. Before the turning points of the Battle of Stalingrad (June 1942 to February, 1943) and the Second Battle of El Alamein (October to November 1942), the fear was that the Germans might attack the area either through Turkey, or via Cyprus into Lebanon; or through defeating of the British in Egypt. If the anticipated attack came through Turkey or Lebanon, then not only could the Axis Powers threaten British controlled Egypt and the strategically important Suez Canal, it would also allow the Germans an alternative route to attack the Soviet Union from Southwest Asia north through the USSR's southern frontiers. In the slightly longer term the British feared independent regimes in the region as well as the possibility that the German might follow in Alexander the Great's footsteps and attack British controlled India from Persia in the west as Japan simultaneously attacked India from the east through Burma.

On April 30 the Iraqi Army surrounded and besieged the isolated and poorly-defended Royal Air Force base at Habbaniya. Although the base had no offensive aircraft, RAF personnel converted training aircraft to carry weapons, and attacked the Iraqi forces.
			* The British counterattacked and defeated the larger but poorly-trained Iraqi Army in a series of battles, even though the Iraqis received direct aid from the Luftwaffe. The British pressed on to Baghdad and then to Mosul. The prime minister and his supporters fled the country and an armistice was signed.

But, when given the choice of being repatriated to France or joining the Free French, only 5,668 men chose to join the forces of General Charles De Gaulle.

	<section name="Anglo-Soviet Invasion of Iran">
		<summary>
			* On August 25, 1941, Britain and Russia launched an invasion of the neutral nation of Iran. The British feared that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company might fall into German hands. The refinery produced 8 million tons of oil and was a crucial part of the Allied war effort. For the Russians, Iran was a country of extreme strategic importance. The Germans were steadily advancing through the Soviet Union and there were few ways for the Allies to get desperately needed American Lend-Lease supplies to the Soviets. With increasing German submarine attacks, as well as heavy ice floes and the coastal ice cap fast rendering convoys to Arkhangelsk impossible, the Trans-Iranian Railway seemed a very attractive route to transport supplies up from the Persian Gulf. The two Allied nations applied pressure on
			Iran and the Shah but this led only to increased tensions and pro-German rallies in Tehran. The Shah refused to expel the many German nationals residing in Iran, and denied the use of the railway to the Allies. These conditions prompted Britain and Russia to invade.
			* Franklin Roosevelt reassured the Shah by claiming that the British and Soviets had no designs on the itegrity of Iran. However, the Soviets would later back separatist states in the north, while the U.S. and UK would later support the overthrow of the popular and democratically elected Iranian Prime Minister in 1953.
			* With this crucial supply route now open to the Soviet Union the Persian Corridor was opened and would provide a massive flow of supplies (over 5 million tons of war materiel) to the Soviets primarily, but also the British in the Middle East.

	<section name="Italian Campaign Overview">
		<summary>
			* The US and British disagreed fiercely on how to prosecute the war. The US argued for an invasion of France as early as possible, while the British advocated a Mediterranean strategy since large numbers of troops trained for amphibious landings in the Mediterranean made a limited-scale invasion possible. Eventually the US and British made the decision to commit to an invasion of France in early 1944, but with a lower-priority Italian campaign reflecting Roosevelt's desire that to keep U.S. troops active in the European theater during 1943 and his attraction to the idea of eliminating Italy from the war.
			* It was hoped that an invasion would knock the Italians out of the war, or provide at least a major propaganda blow. The elimination of Italy as an enemy would also enable the Royal Navy to completely dominate the Mediterranean Sea, massively improving communications with Egypt, the Far East, the Middle East, and India. It would also mean that the Germans would have to transfer troops from the Eastern Front to defend Italy and the entire southern coast of France, thus aiding the Soviets. The Italians would also withdraw their troops from the Soviet Union to defend Italy.
			* It is estimated that between September 1943 and April 1945 some 60,000 Allied and 50,000 German soldiers died in Italy. No campaign in western Europe cost more than Italy, in terms of lives lost and wounds suffered by infantry.

These documents revealed that the Allies were planning to invade Greece, and had no plans to invade Sicily. The documents were accepted as genuine by German intelligence, and as a result much German defensive effort was diverted from Sicily to Greece.

The Allies weren't watching the Axis troops, so they escaped from Messina and reached Italy. Considering Allied naval and air superiority, to not prevent an Axis escape from Sicily was a major strategic blunder. Instead of a major Axis defeat, it started a long and bloody campaign.

	<section name="Invasion of Italy">
		<summary>
			* A coup deposed Benito Mussolini as head of the Italian government, which then began approaching the Allies to make peace. It was believed a quick invasion of Italy might hasten an Italian surrender and produce quick military victories over the German troops that could be trapped fighting in a hostile country. However, Italian and German resistance proved relatively strong, and fighting in Italy continued even after the fall of Berlin. In addition, the invasion left the Allies in a position of supplying food and supplies to conquered territory, a burden which would otherwise have fallen on Germany. As well, Italy occupied by a hostile German army would have created additional problems for the Germans.
			* On September 8, 1943, before the main invasion, the surrender of Italy to the Allies was announced. Italian units ceased combat, and the Navy sailed to Allied ports to surrender. However the German forces in Italy were prepared and moved to disarm Italian units and occupy important defensive positions.
			* On September 9, 1943, the invasion began easily on the beaches near Salerno. The Germans counterattacked several times and inflicted heavy losses. The Germans came close to defeating the Salerno beachhead. Despite using six	divisions of tanks and mechanized infantry, the German attacks had not had sufficient forces to both break through Allied lines and exploit the gains in the face of Allied artillery and naval gunfire support. The Allies had been fortunate that at this time Adolf Hitler had sided with the view of his Army Group commander in Northern Italy, Field Marshall Erwin Rommel, and decided that defending Italy south of Rome was not a strategic priority.
   * By early October, all of Southern Italy was in Allied hands.

		<summary>
			* Kesselring was given command of the whole of Italy and immediately ordered the preparation of a series of defensive lines across Italy south of Rome. Two lines, the Volturno Line and the Barbara Line, were used to delay the Allied advance to buy time to prepare the most formidable defensive positions which formed the Winter Line, the collective name for the Gustav Line and two associated defensive lines on the west of the Apennine mountains, the Bernhardt Line and the Hitler Line. The Winter Line proved a major obstacle to the Allies at the end of 1943, halting their advance on the Fifth Army's front, the western side of Italy.
   * Although the Gustav Line was penetrated on the Eighth Army's Adriatic front and Ortona taken, blizzards, drifting snow and zero visibility at the end of December caused the advance to grind to a halt.
   * The Allies focus then turned to the western front where an attack through the Liri
			valley was considered to have the best chance of a breakthrough towards Rome. Landings at Anzio behind the line were intended to destabilise the German Gustav line defenses, but the hoped for early thrust inland to cut the German defenses off did not occur and the Anzio forces became bottled up in their beach head.
   * It took four major offensives between January and May 1944 before the line was eventually broken along a twenty mile front between Monte Cassino and the western seaboard. At the same time the forces at Anzio broke out of their beachhead but an opportunity to cut off and destroy a large part of the German Tenth Army retreating from the Gustav Line was lost when, on the brink of success, the Anzio forces changed their direction of attack to move parallel with the coast to capture Rome.
   * Rome	was declared an open city by the German army and the US forces took possession on June 4.

			* After the capture of Rome and the Normandy Invasion in June many experienced American and French units, the equivalent of a total of 7 divisions, were pulled out of Italy during the summer of 1944 to participate in Operation Dragoon, the Allied invasion in the south of France.
			* Churchill had hoped that a breakthrough in the autumn of 1944 would open the way for the Allied armies to advance to Vienna and Hungary to forestall the Russians advancing into Eastern Europe. Churchill's proposal had been strongly opposed by the US Chiefs of Staff who understood its importance to British post-war interests in the region but did not feel it aligned with prevailing overall Allied war priorities.
			* Continuation of the Allied offensive in early 1945 was made impractical by the poor winter weather (making armoured manoeuver and exploitation of overwhelming air superiority impossible).
			* On April 9, 1945, the Allies' final offensive commenced with massive aerial and artillery bombardments.
			* As April came to an end, the Axis forces in Italy, retreating on all fronts and having lost most of its fighting powers, was left with little option but surrender.

<chapter name="WWII Pacific Theatre">
	<section name="Battle of Pearl Harbor">
		<summary>
			* On Sunday morning, December 7, 1941, the Japanese navy launched a surprise attack against the Pacific Fleet docked at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii which drew America into World War II. It was intended as a preventive action to remove the U.S. Pacific Fleet to protect Japan's advance into Malaya and the Dutch East Indies — for their natural resources such as oil and rubber.
   * Two aerial attack waves, totaling 353 aircraft, launched from six Japanese aircraft carriers.
			* The attack wrecked two U.S. Navy battleships, one minelayer, and two destroyers beyond repair, and destroyed 188 aircraft; personnel losses were 2,388 killed and 1,178 wounded.
			* The Japanese high command was certain, though mistakenly so, an attack on the United Kingdom's colonies would bring the U.S. into the war, so a preventive strike appeared to be the only way Japan could avoid U.S. interference in the Pacific. While the attack accomplished its intended objective, it was completely unnecessary - unbeknownst to Yamamoto, the U.S. Navy had decided to abandon any intention of 'charging' across the Pacific towards the Philippines at the outset of war back in 1935. They instead adopted 'Plan Dog' in 1940, which emphasized keeping the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) out of the eastern Pacific and the shipping lanes to Australia, while the U.S. concentrated on defeating Nazi Germany.
			* The attack was one of the most important engagements of World War II. Occurring as it did before a formal declaration of war, it pushed U.S. public opinion from isolationism to an acceptance war was unavoidable, as Roosevelt called December 7, 1941 '...a date which will live in infamy.'

		<summary>
			* On December 8, 1941, the same day as the attack on Pearl Harbor, 36 Japanese medium bombers attacked Wake Island, destroying eight of the twelve F4F Wildcat fighters.
			* On December 11, the garrison, with the support of the four remaining Wildcats, repulsed the first Japanese landing attempt, which included the light cruisers Yubari, Tenryū, and Tatsuta; the destroyers Yayoi, Mutsuki, Kisaragi, Hayate, Oite, and Asanagi; two old destroyers converted to patrol boats (Patrol Boat No. 32 and Patrol Boat No. 33), and two troop transport ships containing 450 troops. The U.S. Marines fired at the invasion fleet with their six 5-inch (127 mm) coastal artillery guns. They then succeeded in sinking the Hayate with a direct hit to her magazines and striking the Yubari's superstructure eleven times. The four Wildcats also succeeded in sinking another destroyer,
			by dropping a bomb on her stern where the depth charges were stored. Both Japanese destroyers were lost with all hands, with Hayate becoming the first Japanese surface warship to be sunk during World War II. The Japanese force withdrew before landing.
   * This was the first Japanese defeat of the war. The first battle of Wake Island also marked
			the only occasion in WWII when an amphibious assault was repulsed by shore-based guns.
   * The siege on the Wake garrison continued, without resupply for the Americans. The initial resistance offered by the garrison prompted the Japanese Navy to detach two aircraft carriers (Soryu and Hiryu).
			* The second Japanese invasion force came on December 23, composed mostly of the same ships from the first attempt with some new additions, plus 1,500 Japanese marines. The landings began at 02:35 where, after a preliminary bombardment, the ex-destroyers Patrol Boat No. 32 and Patrol Boat No. 33 were beached and burned in their attempts to land the invasion force.
   * The next day, the Wake garrison surrendered.
			* The U.S. Marines lost 47 killed and 2 MIA during the entire 15-day siege, while three U.S. Navy personnel and at least 70 civilians were killed.
   * Japanese losses were recorded at between 700 to 900 killed, with at least 1,000 more
			wounded, in addition to the two destroyers lost in the first invasion attempt and at least 28 land-based and carrier aircraft either shot down or destroyed. The Japanese captured all men remaining on the island.

				* On December 26, 1941, after securing the beachheads, the Japanese launched a massive pincer attack. The defending forces planned to fall back and hold out for six months, at which time the plan assumed that relief would arrive from the U.S.
				* The surrender of Bataan would hasten the fall of Corregidor, a month later. However, without this stand, the Japanese might have quickly overrun all of the U.S. bases in the Pacific. Bataan forced them to slow down, giving the allies valuable time to prepare for conflicts such as the Battle of the Coral Sea and the Battle of Midway which followed closely thereafter.
				* Ultimately, more than 60,000 Filipino and 15,000 American prisoners of war were forced into the infamous Bataan Death March. The prisoners were forced to march through deep dust for 90 miles. 5000-10000 died en route from disease, starvation, dehydration, heat prostration, untreated wounds, and wanton execution. Those who fell behind were usually executed or left to die; the sides of the roads became littered with dead bodies and those begging for help.

The island bastion of Corregidor, with its network of tunnels and formidable array of defensive armament, along with the fortifications across the entrance to Manila Bay, was the remaining obstacle. The Japanese had to take Corregidor; as long as the island remained in American hands, they would be denied the use of the Manila Bay, the finest natural harbor in the Far East.
			* The two 12-inch (305mm) guns of Batteries Smith and Hearn, with a horizontal range of 29,000 yards (27,000m) and all-around traverse were the longest range of all the island's artillery.
			* From December 29, 1941, to the end of April 1942, despite incessant Japanese aerial, naval and artillery bombardment, the garrison on Corregidor resisted valiantly, inflicting heavy enemy losses in men and planes.
			* The defenders were living on about thirty ounces of food per day. Drinking water was distributed only twice per day, but the constant bombing and shelling often interrupted the ration. When the bombardment killed the mules in the Cavalry, they would drag the carcasses down to the mess hall and cook them.
			* Japanese aircraft flew 614 missions dropping 1,701 bombs totaling some 365 tons of explosive.

	<section name="Doolittle Raid">
		<summary>
			* The Doolittle Raid, 18 April 1942, was the first air raid by the United States to strike the Japanese home island of Honshū during World War II. It demonstrated that the Japanese home islands were vulnerable to Allied air attack. The Doolittle Raid was the only time that United States Army Air Forces bombers were launched from an aircraft carrier.
			* The plan was to launch B-25B bombers from a carrier, hit targets in Japan, and fly on to land in China. All 16 aircraft were lost, and 11 crewmen were either killed or captured. The crews of 13 aircraft, however, were recovered and returned to the United States, and a 14th crew interned by the Soviet Union eventually made its way home in 1943.
			* The Doolittle raid did little material damage, but American morale soared from the depths following Pearl Harbor. The raid also had a strategic impact, though it was not understood at the time, in that it caused the Japanese to recall some fighter units back to the home islands for defense. They did not understand how American aircraft could attack from such a distance and assumed that America had developed a new, extremely long-range aircraft, when in reality, American forces knew it would essentially be a one-way trip. This assumption that the home islands were vulnerable to air attack strengthened Admiral Yamamoto's resolve to carry out military action against Midway Island. These reassignments subsequently weakened Japan's air capabilities against the Allies at the Battle of Midway and later Pacific Theater campaigns.

	<section name="Battle of the Coral Sea">
		<summary>
			* On May 4-8, 1942, the Japanese fought the US and Australian in the first naval battle between aircraft carriers and the first naval battle where neither side's ships sighted or fired directly upon the other.
			* On May 6, 1942, land-based B-17s attacked the approaching Port Moresby invasion fleet with the usual lack of success. Almost another year would pass before the USAAF realized high-altitude bombing attacks against moving naval targets were pointless. That night the commander at Port Moresby made the difficult decision to detach his main surface force (3 cruisers and 3 destroyers) to block the probable course of an invasion. He risked a repeat of the loss of HMS Prince of Wales and Repulse by exposing surface ships to attack by land-based aircraft without air cover. Indeed, his cruisers were spotted and came under an intense air attack from torpedo bombers but escaped with little damage. Only minutes after the Japanese raid, his force was inadvertently attacked by friendly B-17s and once again had to
			endure near misses.
			* On May 7, 1942, U.S. aircraft, sent in the wrong direction by a miscoded contact report, had missed Shōkaku and Zuikaku but found the invasion fleet, escorted by the small carrier Shōhō, which was soon sunk with heavy casualties. In the previous five months the Allies had lost numerous major warships and had been unable to sink a single major Japanese ship in return. Shōhō was small by carrier standards, but the phrase 'scratch one flattop,' announced the first Allied naval success of the Pacific War.
			* On May 8, 1942, the main carrier forces located one another and launched full raids, which passed each other in the air. Shōkaku was hit three times by bombs. Her deck damaged, Shōkaku was unable to land her aircraft and was thus effectively put out of action. Both American carriers were hit: Yorktown by a bomb; the Lexington, by both bombs and torpedoes. Lexington had to be abandoned and sunk to prevent her capture.
			* Tactically, the Japanese had achieved a narrow victory; one small carrier lost and a large carrier severely damaged against the Americans' loss of a large carrier and significant damage to another. But from the Allied point of view, after five months of continuous defeat, a battle that came out almost even was close enough to a victory.
			* Strategically, the Allies had won since the invasion of Port Moresby, New Guinea had been averted (the first time the Japanese had been turned back). With Shōkaku damaged and Zuikaku short of aircraft, neither was able to take part in the crucial Battle of Midway a month later. The loss of Lexington was a severe blow as she was one of the Navy's largest carriers. The damaged Yorktown returned to Pearl Harbor and although her damage was estimated to require months in port, she was made more or less battle-worthy in a miracle of improvisation and determination in just 2 days.

	<section name="Battle of Midway">
		<summary>
			* From June 4, 1942 to June 7, 1942, exactly six months to the day after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor the Americans and Japanese fought around Midway island in what is widely regarded as the most important naval battle in the Pacific.
			* For months, bureaucratic infighting delayed Admiral Yamamoto's plans in the Pacific. In the end, his threat to resign succeeded in moving his agenda forward. Yamamoto's primary strategic concern was the elimination of America's remaining carrier forces. Midway was not especially important, but the Japanese felt that the Americans would strongly defend it. The Japanese believed that only the USS Enterprise and Hornet would be available since the Lexington had been sunk and the Yorktown was badly damaged. Yamamoto dispersed his fleet to deceive the U.S. so the full extent of his fleet was hidden, but the U.S. had broken the Japanese naval code which negated this strategy and left his fleets separated by several hundred miles.
			* In order to battle 4 or 5 carriers, Admiral Nimitz needed every available carrier, so the Yorktown was restored to battle-worthy state in 72 hours. Repairs continued even as Yorktown sortied.
			* A picket line of Japanese submarines was late getting into position (partly because of Yamamoto's haste), which let the American carriers proceed to their assembly point without being detected. Reconnaissance planes were supposed to scout Pearl Harbor prior to the battle to detect American carriers. This plan was also thwarted when the refueling submarines found the refuelling point occupied by American warships (because the Japanese had carried out an identical mission in March). Thus, Japan was deprived of any knowledge concerning the movements of the American carriers. Japanese radio intercepts noticed an increase in both American submarine activity and message traffic. Yamamoto, at sea in Yamato, did not dare inform Nagumo for fear of exposing his position, and presumed (incorrectly)
			Nagumo had received the same message from Tokyo.
			* Admiral Nimitz had one priceless asset: American and British cryptanalysts had broken the JN-25 code, confirming Midway as the target, determining the date of the attack, and providing a complete IJN order of battle. Japan's efforts to introduce a new codebook had been delayed, giving HYPO several crucial days.
			* Nimitz was aware, for example, the vast numerical superiority of the Japanese fleet had been divided into no less than four task forces, and the escort for the main Carrier Striking Force was limited to just a few fast ships. For this reason, they knew the anti-aircraft guns protecting the carriers would be limited. Nimitz calculated his three carriers, plus Midway island, to Yamamoto's four, gave the U.S. rough parity. Meanwhile, the Japanese remained almost totally in the dark even after the battle began.
			* On June 4, nine B-17s operating from Midway attacked the Japanese transport group, but no significant damage was sustained.
			* On June 4, 4:30, Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo launched an attack wave (108 aircraft). At the same time, he launched eight search aircraft (one 30 minutes late due to technical issues).
			* American radar picked up the enemy at a distance of several miles and interceptors soon scrambled. Unescorted bombers headed off to attack the Japanese carrier fleet, their fighter escorts remaining behind to defend Midway.
			* At 06:20, Japanese carrier aircraft bombed and heavily damaged the U.S. base on Midway. Midway-based obsolescent F4F Wildcats, defended Midway and suffered heavy losses. Most were downed in the first few minutes. The Japanese learned the island's bombers had already departed, and the strike leader signaled Nagumo another attack would be necessary to neutralize Midway's defenses before troops could be landed.
			* American anti-aircraft fire was accurate and intense, damaging many Japanese aircraft and claiming a third of the Japanese planes destroyed.
			* American bombers based on Midway made several torpedo attacks on the Japanese carrier fleet, but the Japanese shrugged off these attacks with almost no losses, destroying all but three of the American bombers.
			* At 7:15, As a result of the attacks from Midway, Nagumo ordered his reserve planes to be re-armed with bombs for use on land targets. 30 minutes later a scout plane signaled the discovery of a sizable American naval force to the east. Nagumo quickly reversed his order and demanded the scout plane ascertain the composition of the American force. Another 40 minutes elapsed before Tone's scout finally detected and radioed the presence of a single carrier in the American force, TF 16 (the other carrier was not detected).
			* Nagumo was now in a quandary. His opportunity to hit the American ships was curtailed by the fact his Midway strike force would be returning shortly. They would be low on fuel and carrying wounded crewmen, would need to land promptly or ditch, losing precious aircraft and crews; there was slim chance a strike could be mounted in time. Spotting his flight decks and launching aircraft would require at least 30-45 minutes, but if he launched immediately his bombers would be without fighter escort and they had just witnessed how easily unescorted American bombers were shot down by their own fighters.
			* In the end, Nagumo chose to wait for his first strike force to land, then launch the reserve force. In the final analysis, it made no difference; Fletcher had launched beginning at 07:00, so the aircraft which would deliver the crushing blow were already on their way. There was nothing Nagumo could do about it. This was the fatal flaw of Yamamoto's dispositions: it followed strictly traditional battleship doctrine.
			* It was at this point Spruance gave his second crucial command, to run toward the target, having judged that the need to throw something at the enemy as soon as possible was greater than the need for a coordinated attack. Accordingly, American squadrons were launched piecemeal, proceeding to the target in several different groups. This diminished the overall impact of the American attacks and greatly increased their casualties; coincidentally, it reduced the Japanese ability to counterstrike and found Nagumo with his decks at their most vulnerable.
			* At 9:20, Allied planes began attacking, led by Torpedo Squadron 8 (VT-8, from Hornet), followed by VT-6 (from Enterprise). Every TBD Devastator of VT-8 was shot down, with only one survivor. VT-6 squadron met nearly the same fate, with no hits against the enemy, thanks in part to terrible aircraft torpedoes. The Japanese combat air patrol, flying the much faster Zero, made short work of the Americans, who not only had no fighter support but were flying the slow, under-armed TBDs.
			* The appearance of a third torpedo plane attack from the southeast by VT-3 at 10:00 very quickly drew the majority of the Japanese CAP into the southeast quadrant of the fleet. By chance, at the same time VT-3 was sighted by the Japanese, two separate formations (comprising three squadrons total) of American SBD Dauntless dive-bombers were approaching the Japanese fleet from the northeast and southwest. These formations initially had difficulty in locating the Japanese carriers, and their fuel was running low. However, by the decisions of squadron commanders C. Wade McClusky, Jr. and Max Leslie to continue the search, they spotted the wake of Japanese destroyer Arashi. The destroyer was steaming at full speed back to Nagumo's carrier force, after having unsuccessfully depth-charged the U.S. submarine Nautilus.
			* The American dive-bombers arrived in a perfect position to attack the Japanese. Armed Japanese strike aircraft filled the hangar decks at the time of the fateful attack, fuel hoses were snaking across the decks as refueling operations were hastily completed, and the constant change of ordnance meant bombs and torpedoes were stacked around the hangars rather than stowed safely in the magazines. The Japanese carriers were extraordinarily vulnerable.
			* Contrary to some accounts of the battle, contemporary research, based on recent translation of relevant portions of the 100 volume Japanese account of the war, has demonstrated that the Japanese were not in fact prepared to launch a counterstrike when they were decisively attacked. Because of the constant flight deck activity associated with combat air patrol operations, the Japanese had never had an opportunity to spot their reserve for launch. The few aircraft on the Japanese flight decks at the time of the attack were either CAP fighters, or (in the case of Sōryū) strike fighters being spotted to augment the CAP.
			* At 10:22, Enterprise's aircraft attacked Kaga, while to the south, Yorktown's aircraft attacked carrier Sōryū, with Akagi being struck by several of Enterprise's bombers four minutes later. Simultaneously, VT-3 was targeting Hiryū, although the American torpedo aircraft again scored no hits. Within six minutes, the SBD dive bombers made their attack runs and left all three of their targets heavily ablaze. Akagi was hit by just one bomb, which was sufficient; it penetrated to the upper hangar deck and exploded among the armed and fueled aircraft there. One extremely near miss also slanted in and exploded underwater, bending the flight deck upward with the resulting geyser and causing crucial rudder damage. Sōryū took three bomb hits in the hangar decks; Kaga took at least four. All three carriers were out of action and were eventually abandoned and scuttled.
			* By proceeding to target directly, without waiting for fighter escort, the torpedo squadrons, one after another, at low level, engaged enemy combat air patrol. This created an opportunity for the pilots of the dive bombers, who had arrived high above the action and were able to dive on target before being attacked. The torpedo planes were shot down and the torpedo squadron pilots lost their lives, but they enabled a titanic victory.
   * Hiryū, the sole surviving Japanese aircraft carrier, wasted little time in counterattacking. The first wave of Japanese dive-bombers badly damaged Yorktown with two bomb hits, yet her damage control teams patched her up so effectively (in about an hour) the second wave's torpedo bombers mistook her for an intact carrier. After two torpedo hits, Yorktown lost power and was out of the battle, forcing Admiral Fletcher to move his flag to the heavy cruiser Astoria.
			* Hiryū recovered its aircraft and prepared for a strike against what was believed to be the only remaining American carrier.
			* Enterprise launched a final strike of dive bombers (including 10 bombers from Yorktown), leaving Hiryū ablaze, despite being defended by a strong defensive CAP of over a dozen Zero fighters. Rear Admiral Yamaguchi chose to go down with his ship, costing Japan perhaps her best carrier sailor.
			* In the night, the fleets did not encounter one another which may have been fortunate for the Americans, for had the US carrier fleet come in contact with Yamamoto's heavies, including Yamato, in the dark, the US cruisers would have been overwhelmed, and the carriers helpless.
			* On June 7, Yorktown was sunk during salvage efforts, by three torpedoes from Japanese submarine I-168. There were few casualties since most of the crew had already been evacuated. One torpedo from this salvo also sank the destroyer USS Hammann, which had been providing auxiliary power to Yorktown, splitting her in two.
			* The battle was a decisive victory for the Americans, dealing Japanese naval aviation a heavy blow. The pre-war Japanese training program produced pilots of exceptional quality but at a slow rate. This small group of elite aviators were combat hardened veterans. At Midway, the Japanese lost as many of these pilots in a single day as their training program produced in a year. By mid-1943, Japanese naval aviation was decimated. Even more important was the irredeemable loss of four of Japan's fleet carriers. These ships were not replaced until early in 1945. In the same span of time, the U.S. Navy commissioned more than two dozen fleet and light fleet carriers.

		<summary>
			* On August 7, 1942, US forces landed on the islands of Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Florida in the southern Solomons	capturing Tulagi and Florida as well as an airfield (later named Henderson Field) that was under construction by the	Japanese on Guadalcanal.
			* Between August and November 1942, the Japanese made several attempts to retake Henderson Field. These attempts resulted in three major land battles, five large naval battles, and continuous, almost daily, aircraft battles.
			* In early November 1942 the last Japanese attempt to capture Henderson Field was defeated forcing the Japanese to eventually evacuate Guadalcanal.
			* The Guadalcanal campaign marked the first significant strategic victory by Allied forces over the Japanese in the Pacific and is often considered a 'turning point' in the war.

		<scenario name="Battle of Savo Island">
			<summary>
				* On August 8-9, 1942, the US and Japanese fought the Battle of Savo Island (aka the First Battle of the Solmon Sea in Japan).
				* During the US landing operations, Japanese aircraft based at Rabaul attacked several times. After these clashes, Fletcher (the carrier commander) was concerned about his fuel levels and the losses to his carrier air defense. Without consulting with the other commanders, he withdrew with his carriers. Without carrier air-cover, the transports and their escort fleet would have to withdraw as well, even though less than half of the supplies and heavy equipment had been unloaded. The decision was made, however, to unload as many supplies as possible throughout the night and then depart.
				* That night, as the transports unloaded, two groups of Allied warships, 5 cruisers and 7 destroyers, screening the transports were surprised and defeated by a Japanese force of 7 cruisers and 1 destroyer. One Australian and three U.S. cruisers were sunk, and one other U.S. cruiser and two destroyers were damaged. The Japanese suffered moderate damage to one cruiser. The Japanese who was unaware Fletcher had withdrawn with the U.S. carriers, immediately retired to Rabaul without attempting to attack the now unprotected Allied transports.
				* As a result of the defeat, the remaining Allied ships withdrew from the Solomon Islands. Allied ground forces had landed on Guadalcanal only the day before. The withdrawal of the fleet left them in a precarious situation, with barely enough supplies, equipment, and food to hold their beachhead.

				* After several damaging air attacks, both sides withdrew without securing a clear victory. However, the U.S. apparently gained a greater advantage because the Japanese suffered greater losses including a significant number of aircraft and experienced aircrews.

		<scenario name="First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal">
			<summary>
    * On November 12-15, 1942, the decisive battle was fought during the months long Guadalcanal Campaign. The Japanese organized a transport convoy to take 7,000 infantry troops and their equipment to Guadalcanal to attempt once again to retake Henderson Field airfield. To allow the convoy to approach the island and deliver its cargo, the Japanese navy sent several warship forces to bombard Henderson Field with the goal of destroying Allied aircraft. Learning of the Japanese reinforcement effort, U.S. forces prepared to interdict the Japanese convoy and warships with aircraft and warship attacks.
    * At 1:25 on November 13, 1942 in almost pitch darkness both fleets entered the sound between Savo Island and Guadalcanal. Several of the U.S. ships detected the Japanese ships on radar, but had trouble communicating the information because of problems with their ship's radio equipment and lack of discipline with their communications procedures. Several minutes later, both forces visually sighted each other about the same time. At 01:48, Akatsuki and Hiei turned on large searchlights and lit up Atlanta only 3,000 yards (2.7 km) away—almost point-blank range for large naval artillery. Several of the ships on both sides spontaneously opened fire. As the ships from the two sides intermingled, they battled each other in an utterly confused and chaotic melée at close distances. Afterwards, an officer on Monssen likened it to 'a barroom brawl after the lights had been shot out'
    * At least six of the U.S. ships, including Laffey, O'Bannon, Atlanta, San Francisco, Portland, and Helena, fired at Akatsuki, which drew attention to herself with her illuminated searchlight. Akatsuki was hit repeatedly and blew up and sank within a few minutes.
    * Perhaps because it was the lead cruiser in the U.S. formation, Atlanta was the target of fire from several Japanese ships. It suffered heavy damage and drifted into the line of fire of San Francisco, which accidentally fired on Atlanta, causing even greater damage, and killing Admiral Scott and much of the bridge crew.
    * Hiei, with her nine lit searchlights, huge size, and course taking her directly through the U.S. formation, became the focus of gunfire from many of the U.S. ships. Laffey passed so close to Hiei that they missed colliding by 20 feet (6m). Hiei was unable to depress her main or secondary batteries low enough to hit Laffey, but Laffey was able to rake Hiei's superstructure with 5-inch (130 mm) shells and machine gun fire, causing heavy damage to Hiei's superstructure and bridge, wounding Admiral Abe, and killing his chief of staff.
    * Unable to fire her main or secondary batteries at the three destroyers causing her so much trouble, Hiei instead concentrated on San Francisco which was passing by only 2,500 yards (2.3 km) away.[42] Along with Kirishima, Inazuma, and Ikazuchi, the four ships made repeated hits on San Francisco, disabling her steering control and killing Admiral Callaghan, Captain Cassin Young, and most of the bridge staff. The first few salvos from Hiei and Kirishima consisted of the special fragmentation bombardment shells, which reduced damage to the interior of San Francisco and may have saved her from being sunk outright. Not expecting a ship-to-ship confrontation, it took the crews of the two Japanese battleships several minutes to switch to armor-piercing ammunition.
    * Two of the U.S. destroyers met a sudden demise. Either Nagara or the destroyers Teruzuki and Yukikaze came upon the drifting Cushing and pounded her with gunfire, knocking out all of her systems. Unable to fight back, Cushing's crew abandoned ship. Cushing sank several hours later. Laffey, having escaped from her engagement with Hiei, encountered Asagumo, Murasame, Samidare, and, perhaps, Teruzuki. The Japanese destroyers pounded the Laffey with gunfire and then hit her with a torpedo which broke her keel. A few minutes later fires reached her ammunition magazines and she blew up and sank. Two torpedoes from Amatsukaze hit Barton, immediately sinking her with heavy loss of life. She was accosted by Asagumo, Murasame, and Samidare who had just finished blasting Laffey. They proceeded to smother Monssen with gunfire, damaging her severely and forcing the crew to abandon ship. The ship sank sometime later.
   * At 2:26, after nearly 40 minutes of the brutal, close-quarters fighting, the two sides broke contact.
   * The Japanese had one battleship, one light cruiser, and four destroyers that could continue fighting. The U.S. had only one light cruiser, and one destroyer that were still capable of effective resistance. Although perhaps unclear, the way was clear for the Japanese to bombard Henderson Field and finish off the U.S. naval forces in the area, clearing the way for the troops and supplies to be landed safely on Guadalcanal. However, at this crucial juncture, the Japanese chose to abandon the mission.
   * After the battle, Juneau was torpedoed and sunk by Japanese submarine I-26. Juneau's 100+ survivors (out of a total complement of 650) were left to fend on their own in the open ocean for eight days before rescue aircraft belatedly arrived. While awaiting rescue, all but 10 of Juneau's crew died from their injuries, the elements, or shark attacks.
   * Because of the confused nature of the battle, the U.S. believed that they had sunk as many as seven Japanese ships. This, plus the Japanese retreat, caused the U.S. to believe at the time that they had won a significant victory. It was only after the war that the U.S. learned that they had suffered what most see as a crushing tactical defeat.
   * Nevertheless, most historians appear to agree that Abe's decision to retreat turned this tactical defeat into a strategic victory for the U.S. Henderson Field remained operational with attack aircraft ready to deter the slow Japanese transports from approaching Guadalcanal with their precious cargoes. Plus, the Japanese had lost an opportunity to eliminate the U.S. naval forces in the area, a result which would have taken even the comparatively resource-rich U.S. some time to recover from. Reportedly furious, Admiral Yamamoto relieved Abe of command and later directed his forced retirement from the military.
   * Both sides lost numerous warships in two extremely destructive nighttime surface engagements, with the U.S. suffering more warships sunk or heavily damaged than the Japanese. The U.S., however, was successful in turning back attempts by the Japanese to bombard Henderson Field with battleships. Air attacks by Allied aircraft also sank most of the Japanese troop transports and prevented the majority of the Japanese troops and equipment from reaching Guadalcanal. The battle turned back Japan's last major attempt to dislodge Allied forces from Guadalcanal and nearby Tulagi, resulting in a strategic victory for the U.S. and its allies and deciding the ultimate outcome of the Guadalcanal campaign in favor of Allied forces.

			<summary>
				* On the night of November 14-15, 1942, to cover the unloading of the transports at Guadalcanal, the Japanese fleet made its third attempt to neutralize Henderson Field, sending the force of warships through Indispensable Strait to bombard Guadalcanal.
				* Low on undamaged ships, the U.S., detached a scratch force; the new battleships had only operated together for a few days, and their four escorts were from four different divisions—chosen simply because, of the available destroyers, they had the most fuel.
				* At 23:22 The U.S. destroyers in the front of the column engaged Nagara, Ayanami, and 4 destroyers. The Japanese responded effectively with accurate gunfire and torpedoes, and destroyers Walke and Preston were hit and sunk within 10 minutes with heavy loss of life. The destroyer Benham had part of her bow blown off by a torpedo and had to retreat (she sank the next day), and destroyer Gwin was hit in her engine room and put out of the fight. However, the U.S. destroyers had completed their mission as screens for the battleships, absorbing the initial impact of contact with the enemy, although at great cost. Washington passed through the area still occupied by the damaged and sinking U.S. destroyers and fired on Ayanami with her secondary batteries, setting her afire. Following close behind, South Dakota suddenly suffered a series of electrical failures, reportedly during repairs when her chief engineer locked down a circuit breaker in violation of safety procedures, causing her circuits repeatedly to go into series, making her radar, radios, and most of her gun batteries inoperable.
				* At 00:00 on November 15, 1942, almost blind and unable to effectively fire her main and secondary armament, South Dakota was illuminated by searchlights and targeted by gunfire and torpedoes by most of the ships of the Japanese force, including Kirishima. Although able to score a few hits on Kirishima, South Dakota took 25 medium and one large-caliber hit, some of which did not explode, that completely knocked out her communications and remaining gunfire control operations, set portions of her upper decks on fire, and forced her to try to steer away from the engagement.
				* The Japanese ships continued to concentrate their fire on South Dakota and none detected Washington approaching to within 9,000 yards (8 km). Washington was tracking a large target (Kirishima) for some time but refrained from firing since there was a chance it could be South Dakota. Washington had not been able to track South Dakota's movements because she was in a blind spot in the Washington's radar and Lee could not raise her on the radio to confirm her position. When the Japanese illuminated and fired on South Dakota, all doubts were removed as to which ships were friend or foe. From this close range, Washington opened fire and quickly hit Kirishima with at least nine main battery shells and almost forty secondary ones, causing heavy damage and setting her aflame. Kirishima was hit below the waterline and suffered a jammed rudder, causing her to circle uncontrollably to port.
				* Washington then withdrew to draw the Japanese away from the South Dakota. Kirishima and Ayanami were scuttled in the night. At 4:00, the four Japanese transports beached themselves to quickly unload their reinforcements and cargo, but at 5:55 they were attacked by U.S. aircraft from Henderson Field and from field artillery which destroyed most of the ammunition and food supplies that had not yet been unloaded.
				* The failure to deliver most of the troops and supplies in the convoy to Guadalcanal prevented the Japanese from launching another offensive to retake Henderson Field.
				* By late December 1942, the U.S. was able to land 2 fresh divisions of infantry.
				* On December 31, 1942, the Japanese abandoned Guadalcanal.

			* The 82 day battle lasted from late March through June 1945 and was the largest amphibious assault in the Pacific Theater. The battle has one of the highest casualties: the Japanese lost over 100,000 troops, and the Allies (mostly United States) suffered more than 50,000 casualties, with over 12,000 killed in action. Hundreds of thousands of civilians were killed, wounded or attempted suicide.
			* The main objective of the operation was to seize a large island only 340 miles away from mainland Japan. Okinawa was to serve as a springboard for the invasion of Japan, though the the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki caused Japan to surrender just weeks after the end of the fighting at Okinawa and the invasion never took place.
			* Some military historians believe that Okinawa led directly to the use of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. '...because the Japanese on Okinawa, including native Okinawans, were so fierce in their defense (even when cut off, and without supplies), and because casualties were so appalling, many American strategists looked for an alternative means to subdue mainland Japan. This means presented itself, with the advent of atomic bombs, which worked admirably in convincing the Japanese to sue for peace, without American casualties. Ironically, the American conventional fire-bombing of major Japanese cities (which had been going on for months before Okinawa) was far more effective at killing civilians than the atomic bombs and, had the Americans simply continued, or expanded this, the Japanese would likely have surrendered anyway. Nevertheless, the bombs were a powerful symbolic display of American power, and the Japanese capitulated, obviating the need for an invasion.'

			* These are to date the only attacks with nuclear weapons in the history of warfare. The bombs killed as many as 140,000 people in Hiroshima and 80,000 in Nagasaki by the end of 1945, roughly half on the days of the bombings.
			* Since then, thousands more have died from injuries or illness attributed to exposure to radiation. In both cities, the overwhelming majority of the dead were civilians.

				* Among the most revolutionary and influential tank designs in history. The FT 17 was the first tank with an armament in a fully rotating turret, and its configuration with the turret on top, engine in the back and the driver in front became the conventional one, repeated in most tanks until today; at the time it was a revolutionary innovation, causing armour historian Steven Zaloga to describe the type as 'the world's first modern tank.' The tank was widely used by the French and the Americans (who, as mentioned, were lent 514) in the latter stages of World War I, after 31 May 1918. The tank was cheap and well-suited for mass production. Indeed, the very production was made a weapon in itself: a goal was set of 12,260 to be produced (4,440 of which in the USA) before the end of 1919.This prospect was one of several factors which drove the German High Command to its decision to launch the massive all-or-nothing offensives in the spring of 1918, which in turn weakened their army so that it collapsed in the summer. FT 17 tanks were also used in the Second World War, among others in Poland, Finland, France and Kingdom of Yugoslavia, although they were completely obsolete by then.

				* P-47 pilots frequently carried two 500-pound (227 kg) bombs, using skip bombing techniques for difficult targets (skipping bombs into railroad tunnels to destroy hidden enemy locomotives or tanks was a favorite tactic); a near miss was sufficient to knock a tank on its side, blow off a track or turret, or cause serious damage to tracks, suspension, and turret mechanisms, frequently causing the vehicle to be abandoned by its crew.

			<reference>
				* Although the explosions of the standard United States 600-pound (270 kg) Mark 4 or Mark 7 depth charge used in World War II were nerve-wracking to the target, an undamaged U-boat's pressure hull would not rupture unless the charge detonated closer than about five meters. Placing the weapon within this range was entirely a matter of chance and quite unlikely as the target maneuvered evasively during the attack. Most U-boats sunk by depth charges were destroyed by damage accumulated from a long barrage rather than by a single carefully-aimed attack. Many survived hundreds of depth charge detonations over a period of many hours.
				* The depth charge causes damage by both the initial shock wave and by the subsequent reverberating shock waves that have a tendency to bend a submarine back and forth cause a hull breach.
				* A 100kg of TNT depth charge would have a kill radius of 3-4m. Higher payloads only increase this by a few meters because the effect decreases with the distance cubed. The killing range is also greater with larger submarines. It is doubtful a midget submarine with a titanium hull could be destroyed by anything less than a direct hit.

				* The M24 was not up to the challenge of fighting German tanks, but the bigger gun at least gave its crews a chance to fight back when it was required. The M24's light armor made it vulnerable to virtually all of the German tanks, anti-tank guns, and hand-held anti-tank weapons. The contribution of the M24 to winning the war in Europe was insignificant, as they arrived too late and in too few numbers to replace the worn out M5s.

				* In the South West Pacific theater, the P-38 was the primary long-range fighter of United States Army Air Forces until the appearance of large numbers of P-51D Mustangs toward the end of the war. The P-38 was probably the quietest fighter in history. It was extremely forgiving, and could be mishandled in many ways, but the rate of roll was too slow for it to excel as a dogfighter. The P-38 was the only American fighter aircraft in production throughout American involvement in the war.

				* The New Orleans took one Long-Lance Torpedo which severed 150ft of her bow. Magnificent damage control work and skillful seamanship kept it afloat. New Orleans class cruisers would be found at every major naval skirmish of WWII despite the fact there were only four units remaining after 1942. They were some of the most used and hardest fought ships on the US Navy during the war. They would have three of the top four most decorated ships in the US Navy in World War II.

Against armored targets, the bag could be filled completely with explosive.

The High Capacity design was a cylinder full of explosives, unaerodynamic, and without find. Accuracy was not important, however, as these bombs were designed for blowing the tiles off the roofs of buildings so that the smaller 4 lb incendiary bombs could reach the building interiors. These bombs were only used by the RAF, being too big to fit in the bomb bays of other countries aircraft.

				* The Earthquake bombs were designed not to strike a target directly, but to impact beside it, penetrate under it, and create a 'camouflet' or large buried cavern at the same time as delivering a shock wave through the target's foundations. The target then collapses into the hole, no matter how hardened it may be. The bombs had strong casings because they needed to travel through rock rather than reinforced concrete, though they could perform equally well against hardened surfaces.

Although Caldwell was wounded three times, and his Tomahawk was hit by more than 100 7.9 mm bullets and five 20 mm cannon shells, he survived the encounter and shot down Schruer's wingman.

				* The first practical anti-aircraft rocket. After the war the R4M served as the pattern for a number of similar systems, used by almost all interceptor aircraft during the 1940s and '50s. The R4M used a large warhead of 55mm with 520g explosive charge, nearly guaranteeing a kill with one hit. A battery typically consisted of two groups of 12 rockets and when all 24 were fired at once they would fill an area about 15 by 30 m at 1000 m, dense enough that one was almost certain to hit its target. Two warheads were available for the R4M, the common PB-3 with a 0.4 kg charge for anti-aircraft use and the larger shaped charge, similar in construction to the Panzerschreck, the Panzerblitz II (PB-2), for anti-tank use.

				* During the Battle of Crete, the Ultra enabled the British to wait on each German drop zone, yet despite	compromised secrecy, surviving German paratroops pushed the Commonwealth forces off the island. However, the	losses were so great that Hitler forbade their future use. He felt that the main power of the paratroop was	novelty, and that the British had clearly figured out how to defend against them. Ironically, the battle that	ended Germany's paratrooper operations had the opposite effect on the Allies. Convinced of the effectiveness of	airborne assaults, the Allies hurried to train and organize their own airborne units.

The RSI was to be an Italian regime which was to nominally administer the German-occupied northern Italy.

The authorities believed Nazi propaganda that German heavy tanks carried exceptionally strong armour. So the project was run purely on the initiative of Grabin, his design bureau and the Artillery Factory No. 92 head and his deputies. None of them informed state authorities about the ZiS-3 project until the authorities belatedly realized that Nazi tanks were often destroyed by even lighter guns.

				* The low-speed, low-altitude turning nature of most air combat on the Russian Front suited the P-39's strengths: sturdy construction, reliable radio gear, and adequate firepower. The second-highest 				scoring Allied ace, Aleksandr Pokryshkin, flew the P-39. His unofficial score stands at nearly 60 Luftwaffe aircraft. His wingman, Grigori Rechkalov, scored 57 victories with the P-39. This is the highest score ever gained by any pilot with any U.S.-made aircraft.
