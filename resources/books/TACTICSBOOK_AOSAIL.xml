		<summary>
			The Age of Sail was the period in which international trade and naval warfare were dominated by sailing ships,
			lasting from the 16th to the mid 19th century.  This is a significant period during which square-rigged sailing
			ships carried European settlers to many parts of the world in one of the most expansive human migrations in
			recorded history.

			<reference>
				A blunderbuss is a muzzle-loading firearm with a flared, trumpet-like barrel and is the predecessor to the
				shotgun.  Most of these weapons are mid-sized, being smaller than most shoulder-fired arms, but larger than a
				pistol.  The muzzle was flared not to increase the spread of the shot, but rather to funnel powder and shot into
				the weapon, making it easier to reload on horseback or on a moving carriage.
